# Feature: CUDA Build Pipeline and Smoke Test Kernel <!-- rq-cc1b997d -->

The project compiles CUDA C kernels to PTX at build time and loads them at
runtime via cudarc. A trivial "fill" kernel serves as a permanent smoke test
that validates the entire toolchain end-to-end: `nvcc` compilation, PTX
embedding, device initialization, kernel launch, and host readback.

## Build Script <!-- rq-438b895b -->

A `build.rs` build script compiles every `.cu` file under `kernels/` to PTX
using `nvcc`.

### nvcc invocation <!-- rq-f379e47c -->

For each `.cu` file, `build.rs` invokes:

```
nvcc --ptx -std=c++17 -o <out_dir>/<stem>.ptx <source_path>
```

where `<out_dir>` is the value of the `OUT_DIR` environment variable set by
Cargo and `<stem>` is the file name without the `.cu` extension. The
`-std=c++17` flag is required so kernels can use `if constexpr` and
function templates.

`build.rs` emits `cargo:rerun-if-changed=kernels/` so that Cargo reruns the
build script whenever any file under `kernels/` changes.

### Missing nvcc <!-- rq-4a3feaf7 -->

If `nvcc` is not found on `PATH` or exits with a non-zero status, `build.rs`
panics with a message that includes:

- The failing command and its exit code (or "not found" if the binary is
  absent).
- A note that the CUDA Toolkit is required and a pointer to the NVIDIA
  installation documentation.

### PTX embedding <!-- rq-c1cfec9a -->

Each compiled PTX file is made available to Rust source code via
`include_str!`. `build.rs` writes a generated Rust file to `OUT_DIR` that
contains one `pub const` per kernel module:

```rust
pub const FILL: &str = include_str!("<out_dir>/fill.ptx");
```

The generated file is included in the Rust source tree with
`include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/kernels.rs"))`.

## GPU Device Module <!-- rq-0c3a23bb -->

`src/gpu/device.rs` exposes a function for obtaining an initialized CUDA
device with all compiled PTX modules loaded, together with a typed,
per-subsystem nested handle to every kernel function.

### Functions <!-- rq-c38c8f3b -->

- `init_device() -> Result<GpuContext, GpuError>`
  - Calls `CudaDevice::new(0)` to initialize the default CUDA device.
  - Calls `Kernels::load(&device)`, which in turn invokes every
    subsystem's `XKernels::load(device)` associated function. Each
    `load` is responsible for loading its own PTX module onto the
    device with `CudaDevice::load_ptx` and pulling its function
    handles with `CudaDevice::get_func`.
  - Returns a `GpuContext` bundling the `Arc<CudaDevice>` and the
    composed `Arc<Kernels>` handle.
  - Returns `Err(GpuError)` if device creation, any subsystem's PTX
    loading, or any subsystem's kernel lookup fails. The first
    failing subsystem short-circuits the rest.

### Types <!-- rq-2093594f -->

- `GpuError` — error type for GPU operations. Wraps the underlying
  `cudarc::driver::DriverError`.

- `GpuContext` — the value returned by `init_device`. A plain struct with
  two public fields and no `Deref`:
  - `device: Arc<CudaDevice>` — the initialized cudarc device, used for
    memory allocation and host/device transfers.
  - `kernels: Arc<Kernels>` — the kernel-function handle.

  Both fields are cheap to clone, so each GPU-resource struct stores its
  own clones rather than borrowing the `GpuContext`.

- `Kernels` — composed handle holding, for every CUDA kernel compiled
  from `kernels/*.cu`, its launchable function. The composition is
  per-subsystem-nested: `Kernels` carries one field per subsystem,
  each holding that subsystem's typed sub-struct. Kernel launch sites
  obtain their function through a two-level field chain
  (`particle_buffers.kernels.<subsystem>.<kernel_name>`) rather than a
  string-keyed lookup. A reference to a non-existent kernel is a
  compile error, and a kernel missing from its PTX module is caught
  once, by `init_device`, rather than on first launch. Adding a new
  kernel to an existing subsystem is a one-line edit to the
  subsystem's own kernel struct, and adding a new subsystem is a
  one-line edit to `Kernels` (plus the new subsystem file). `device.rs`
  does not name any individual kernel.

  The subsystem field set is:

  Each subsystem's sub-struct carries one `pub <name>: CudaFunction`
  field per kernel listed in its row, and provides an associated
  function `pub fn load(device: &Arc<CudaDevice>) -> Result<Self, GpuError>`
  that loads the PTX module and pulls the function handles. The struct
  derives `Debug + Clone` (a `CudaFunction` is itself cheap to clone).

  Cross-subsystem reads follow the home rule: a kernel lives in the
  sub-struct named after its `.cu` file, and consumers in other
  subsystems reach into that sub-struct directly. For example, the
  `kinetic_energy_reduce` and `rescale_velocities` kernels live in
  `kernels.nose_hoover.*` and are consumed by NHC, CSVR, and the MTK
  barostat substep. No kernel handle is duplicated across sub-structs.

## Fill Kernel <!-- rq-599b2eb4 -->

`kernels/fill.cu` contains a CUDA kernel that writes a constant value to
every element of a floating-point output buffer.

### Kernel signature <!-- rq-25afada1 -->

```c
extern "C" __global__ void fill(float *out, float value, unsigned int n)
```

- `out` — pointer to the output buffer on the device.
- `value` — the constant value to write.
- `n` — number of elements in the buffer.

Each thread computes its global index as `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x`.
If the index is less than `n`, it writes `value` to `out[index]`.

## Smoke Test <!-- rq-c669b757 -->

An integration test in `tests/smoke_gpu.rs` validates the full pipeline.

### Test procedure <!-- rq-f7fe7f1b -->

1. Call `init_device()` to obtain a `GpuContext`.
2. Allocate a device buffer of 1024 `f32` elements using `CudaDevice::alloc_zeros`.
3. Launch the `fill` kernel — obtained from the `GpuContext`'s `kernels`
   handle — with `value = 1.0` and `n = 1024`.
   - Block size: 256 threads.
   - Grid size: `ceil(n / 256)` blocks.
4. Copy the buffer back to the host using `CudaDevice::dtoh_sync_copy`.
5. Assert that every element in the host buffer is exactly `1.0_f32`.

### Edge case: non-block-aligned buffer size <!-- rq-89d64ca3 -->

A second test case uses a buffer size that is not a multiple of the block size
(e.g., 1000) to verify that the kernel's bounds check works correctly and no
out-of-bounds writes occur.

## Project Structure <!-- rq-b735d0b0 -->

```
build.rs                  # compiles kernels/*.cu to PTX, generates kernels.rs
kernels/
  fill.cu                 # trivial fill kernel (permanent smoke test)
src/
  gpu/
    mod.rs                # re-exports gpu submodules
    device.rs             # init_device(), GpuContext, Kernels, GpuError
    fill.rs               # FillKernels (smoke-test kernel handle)
    barostat_kernels.rs   # BarostatKernels (shared by Berendsen + c-rescale)
tests/
  smoke_gpu.rs            # integration test for fill kernel
Cargo.toml                # depends on cudarc
```

Subsystem `*Kernels` sub-structs live next to the code that owns each
PTX module (see the *Types* table above for the full home list).
`src/gpu/device.rs` carries `init_device`, `GpuContext`, `GpuError`,
and the central `Kernels` struct whose fields are typed sub-structs —
it does not name any individual kernel.

## Dependencies <!-- rq-93367a8f -->

`Cargo.toml` declares:

- `cudarc` — CUDA device management, memory allocation, and kernel launch.

No other new dependencies are introduced.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-e9a67206 -->

- Real simulation kernels (pair force, reduction, integration).
- SoA particle state buffers.
- The `f64` precision feature flag (the fill kernel uses `float`/`f32` only).
- Multi-GPU support (the smoke test uses device 0).

## Gherkin Scenarios <!-- rq-61606908 -->

```gherkin
Feature: CUDA build pipeline and smoke test kernel

  # --- Build script ---

  @rq-de92101c
  Scenario: build.rs compiles a .cu file to PTX
    Given a file "kernels/fill.cu" containing a valid CUDA kernel
    And nvcc is available on PATH
    When cargo build is run
    Then a file "fill.ptx" is produced in OUT_DIR
    And the build succeeds

  @rq-c17ef35f
  Scenario: PTX is embedded in the Rust binary
    Given the build has succeeded
    When the generated kernels.rs is inspected
    Then it contains a pub const FILL whose value is the contents of fill.ptx

  # --- Device initialization ---

  @rq-05691d2f
  Scenario: init_device succeeds on a machine with a CUDA GPU
    Given a CUDA-capable GPU is available as device 0
    When init_device() is called
    Then it returns Ok containing a GpuContext
    And the GpuContext's kernels handle exposes the fill function as
      `gpu_context.kernels.fill.fill`

  @rq-299c69c9
  Scenario: init_device fails when no GPU is available
    Given no CUDA-capable GPU is available
    When init_device() is called
    Then it returns Err(GpuError)

  # --- Per-subsystem kernel composition ---

  @rq-6211a82f
  Scenario: Kernels is composed of per-subsystem sub-structs
    Given a GpuContext obtained from init_device()
    Then gpu_context.kernels has fields named after each subsystem
      in the Types table: fill, integrate, spme_recip, langevin,
      morse, angle, nose_hoover, andersen, barostat, mtk, settle,
      forces, neighbor
    And each field is the matching subsystem's typed kernel struct

  @rq-6745e7c5
  Scenario: Each subsystem's XKernels::load returns its kernel handle
    Given a CUDA-capable GPU initialized via CudaDevice::new(0)
    When SpmeRecipKernels::load(&device) is called
    Then it returns Ok(SpmeRecipKernels) whose `spme_charge_spread` field
      is a launchable CudaFunction
    And the PTX module `spme_recip` is loaded on the device

  @rq-cfc89131
  Scenario: A subsystem load that names a missing kernel surfaces as GpuError at init_device
    Given a CUDA-capable GPU is available
    And a subsystem's load(...) names a kernel that does not appear in
      its PTX module (e.g. via a typo)
    When init_device() is called
    Then it returns Err(GpuError) at that subsystem's load step
    And no subsequent subsystem's load is invoked

  @rq-7b651edb
  Scenario: Cross-subsystem reads pull from the kernel's home sub-struct
    Given a GpuContext obtained from init_device()
    Then the Nose-Hoover launch wrapper reads
      `particle_buffers.kernels.nose_hoover.kinetic_energy_reduce` for
      the shared kinetic-energy reduction kernel
    And the same `kinetic_energy_reduce` handle is used by the CSVR
      thermostat launch wrapper

  # --- Fill kernel correctness ---

  @rq-9cf657ed
  Scenario: fill kernel writes 1.0 to every element of a block-aligned buffer
    Given a GpuContext obtained from init_device()
    And a device buffer of 1024 f32 elements initialized to zero
    When the fill kernel is launched with value=1.0 and n=1024
    And the buffer is copied back to the host
    Then all 1024 host elements are exactly 1.0_f32

  @rq-26d8c08c
  Scenario: fill kernel handles a non-block-aligned buffer size
    Given a GpuContext obtained from init_device()
    And a device buffer of 1000 f32 elements initialized to zero
    When the fill kernel is launched with value=1.0 and n=1000
    And the buffer is copied back to the host
    Then all 1000 host elements are exactly 1.0_f32

  @rq-d920e446
  Scenario: fill kernel does not write beyond the buffer
    Given a GpuContext obtained from init_device()
    And a device buffer of 1024 f32 elements initialized to zero
    When the fill kernel is launched with value=1.0 and n=1000
    And the buffer is copied back to the host
    Then the first 1000 elements are exactly 1.0_f32
    And the remaining 24 elements are exactly 0.0_f32
```
