# Feature: Constraint Slot Framework <!-- rq-3d5f2e98 -->

The runner exposes a fourth orthogonal slot — `Constraint` — alongside the
`Integrator`, `Thermostat`, and `Barostat` slots described in
`framework.md`. The constraint slot projects per-particle positions and
velocities onto a holonomic constraint manifold (rigid bonds, rigid
groups, etc.) at fixed sub-step boundaries inside the integrator. The
slot is independently registered, independently selectable from the
config, and composes with the other three slots without modifying the
base `Integrator` trait. The convenience-trait surface that lets
callers invoke an integrator with a constraint slot is split so that
only constraint-capable integrators expose it; see *Convenience Trait
Surface* below.

The default registry exposes one constraint algorithm:

| `kind` value | Implementation                                                                                         | File       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| `shake`      | iterative SHAKE position projection + iterative RATTLE velocity projection on arbitrary rigid groups (compile-time caps `MAX_GROUP_ATOMS = 8`, `MAX_GROUP_CONSTRAINTS = 12`) | `shake.md` |

The slot is selectable in any simulation whose declared integrator
returns `IntegratorBuilder::supports_constraints(&params) == true`. In the default
registry, only `velocity-verlet { lossless = false }` supports
constraints. Composing constraints with any other integrator — or with
`velocity-verlet { lossless = true }` — is rejected at config load.

## Sources of Constraint Topology <!-- rq-31518680 -->

Constraints have two declaration sites and one runtime artefact:

1. **`[[constraint_types]]` in the TOML config** — declares each named
   constraint geometry and the algorithm that consumes it (see
   `io/config-schema.md`).
2. **`[constraints]` section in the `.topology` file** — declares one
   row per constraint group (one rigid molecule or one rigid cluster),
   each row naming the atom indices it covers and the constraint-type
   name from the config (see `forces/topology.md`).
3. **`ConstraintList`** — the host-side parsed artefact produced by
   `load_topology_file` from the two sources above. Carries the
   per-group SoA documented in *Constraint Data Layout* below.

A simulation has a `Constraint` slot iff `ConstraintList::is_empty()` is
`false`. The slot's lifecycle is identical to the other three slots:
constructed once at runner start, owned by the runner for the lifetime
of the run, dropped at end of run.

## Per-Step Interface <!-- rq-f08d7a33 -->

The constraint slot's hooks are fired by the runner during its walk of
the integrator's `StepPlan` (see `framework.md`). The integrator
describes its work as an ordered sequence of `SubStep`s; the runner
identifies the canonical hook positions by inspecting the variant of
each sub-step and inserts the corresponding hook call. Integrators
never reference the constraint slot.

The four hook positions are:

| Hook                              | When the runner fires it                                                                | What the slot does                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apply_before_drift`              | Immediately before every `SubStep::Drift` or `SubStep::KickDrift` the integrator executes | Snapshots the pre-drift positions of every atom the slot owns into the slot's internal buffer.                                                |
| `apply_after_drift`               | Immediately after every `SubStep::Drift` or `SubStep::KickDrift` the integrator executes | Projects positions back onto the constraint manifold; updates the corresponding half-step velocities so they remain consistent with the projected displacement. |
| `apply_after_kick`                | Once per timestep, after the final sub-step in the plan, iff that sub-step is a `SubStep::KickHalf` or `SubStep::KickDrift` | Projects velocities onto the constraint manifold so the time-derivative of every constraint is zero at the new positions.                     |
| `apply_position_projection_only`  | After each trial position update inside an energy-minimization phase (see `rqm/minimization/steepest-descent.md`) | Projects positions back onto the constraint manifold without modifying velocities or virials. Does not consume `dt`. |

The first three hooks fire only during the integrator's plan walk in
MD phases. The fourth hook fires only during minimization phases and
is driven by the runner's minimization loop (see
`rqm/minimization/steepest-descent.md`).

For the registered `velocity-verlet` (lossy) integrator, whose plan is
`[KickDrift, ForceEval, KickHalf]` (see `velocity-verlet.md`), the
runner's interleaved sequence becomes:

```text
constraint.apply_before_drift(buffers, sim_box, dt, timings)
integrator.execute(SubStep::KickDrift { .. }, buffers, sim_box, timings)
constraint.apply_after_drift(buffers, sim_box, dt, timings)
force_field.step(buffers, sim_box, timings)
integrator.execute(SubStep::KickHalf { .. }, buffers, sim_box, timings)
constraint.apply_after_kick(buffers, sim_box, dt, timings)
```

When the constraint slot is `None`, the runner skips hook insertion
entirely; the plan walk reduces to the bare sub-step dispatch. When
`IntegratorBuilder::supports_constraints(&params)` returns `false`
the runner also skips hook insertion (and the config loader rejects this
combination with a non-empty `[constraints]` section before the run
starts). When the plan contains no `Drift` or `KickDrift` sub-steps,
only the final-velocity `apply_after_kick` hook can fire — and only
if the plan's last sub-step is a `KickHalf` or `KickDrift`.

The runner brackets each hook call with its own timings stage
(`CONSTRAINT_BEFORE_DRIFT`, `CONSTRAINT_AFTER_DRIFT`,
`CONSTRAINT_AFTER_KICK`) using `timings.kernel_start` /
`timings.kernel_stop`; the slot's internal kernels record their own
finer-grained stages within those brackets.

`apply_before_drift`, `apply_after_drift`, and `apply_after_kick` each
receive `&SimulationBox` (immutably) to read lattice parameters for
minimum-image distance evaluation; none mutates the box.

## Convenience Trait Surface <!-- rq-0e26dde0 -->

The runner walks an integrator's plan via the free function
[`run_step`] in `src/integrator/mod.rs`, threading the runner-side
`install_constraint_hooks` flag from
`IntegratorBuilder::supports_constraints(&params)` explicitly. Tests
and direct library consumers use a convenience layer instead. That
layer is split into two traits so that the `&mut dyn Constraint`
argument is reachable only from a type that has statically opted in to
constraint-hook insertion:

- **`IntegratorStepExt`** — a blanket convenience trait implemented
  for every type that implements `Integrator`. Its single method
  `step(...)` walks the integrator's plan without installing any
  constraint hooks. The method takes no `Constraint` argument and
  the runner-side `install_constraint_hooks` flag is hard-wired to
  `false`. Available on every `Integrator` (`velocity-verlet`,
  `langevin-baoab`, `mtk-npt`, …).
- **`IntegratorStepWithConstraintExt`** — a convenience trait whose
  blanket impl is bounded on `Self: ConstraintCapableIntegrator`. Its
  single method `step_with_constraint(..., &mut dyn Constraint, ...)`
  walks the plan with `install_constraint_hooks = true`. Available
  only on types that statically declare themselves
  constraint-capable; calling it on a non-marker type is a compile
  error.

The runner consumes `run_step` directly and bypasses both convenience
traits, so its hook-insertion behaviour is unaffected.

### ConstraintCapableIntegrator marker <!-- rq-866dcea2 -->

`ConstraintCapableIntegrator: Integrator` is implemented exactly for
the integrator types whose `StepPlan` shape is compatible with the
constraint slot's hook positions. In the default registry:

- `VelocityVerletState` implements `ConstraintCapableIntegrator`.
- `LangevinBaoabState` does not implement
  `ConstraintCapableIntegrator`.
- `MtkNptIntegrator` does not implement
  `ConstraintCapableIntegrator`.

A constraint-capable integrator type whose runtime state nevertheless
forbids constraint-hook installation declares that state through the
trait's `check_accepts_constraints_now(&self) -> Result<(), &'static str>`
method. The default returns `Ok(())`; `VelocityVerletState` overrides
it to return `Err("velocity-Verlet in lossless mode does not yet
support constraints")` when its `lossless` field is `true`.

`step_with_constraint` consults `check_accepts_constraints_now()`
before walking the plan. When the predicate returns `Err(reason)`,
the call returns `StepError::IntegratorRejectsConstraint { reason }`
without dispatching `plan()`, `execute()`, or any kernel. This makes
the runtime mismatch between a constraint-capable type and a
constraint-rejecting state visible to programmatic callers; the
runner remains protected by the config-load validation in
`Config::validate_against(&registries)` and never calls
`step_with_constraint` itself.

## Compatibility Rules <!-- rq-acfda5d4 -->

- An integrator whose builder's
  `IntegratorBuilder::supports_constraints(&params)` returns `false`
  is incompatible with a non-empty `[constraints]` section of the
  topology file. `Config::validate_against(&registries)` (see
  `io/config-schema.md`) returns
  `ConfigError::IncompatibleConstraint { integrator: <kind name> }`
  at config load.
- The `"velocity-verlet"` builder returns `false` from
  `supports_constraints(&{ lossless: true })`. Combining lossless
  velocity-Verlet with constraints is therefore rejected with the
  same error; lossless support is deferred to a future feature.
- The `"langevin-baoab"` and `"mtk-npt"` builders return `false`
  from `supports_constraints(&params)` regardless of the params they
  receive.
- When the chosen integrator's builder's
  `supports_constraints(&params)` returns `true` but the topology has
  no `[constraints]` section, the runner holds `None` for the
  constraint slot and the integrator's hooks are skipped.
- The convenience-trait surface enforces the type-level half of the
  same rule. `IntegratorStepWithConstraintExt::step_with_constraint`
  is bounded on `Self: ConstraintCapableIntegrator`, so calling it on
  a non-marker type (`LangevinBaoabState`, `MtkNptIntegrator`, …) is
  a compile error. The runtime half — declaring that a
  `ConstraintCapableIntegrator` instance's current state forbids
  hook installation — runs through
  `check_accepts_constraints_now()` and surfaces as
  `StepError::IntegratorRejectsConstraint`. `VelocityVerletState`
  with `lossless = true` is the one current trigger of this runtime
  rejection.

## Constraint Data Layout <!-- rq-be5d5b33 -->

The host-side `ConstraintList` is the canonical parsed-and-validated
view of every constraint declared by the topology file. It is shaped to
accommodate algorithms that operate on rigid clusters whose size fits
the per-group caps of the active algorithm — for SHAKE in the default
registry, `MAX_GROUP_ATOMS = 8` atoms and `MAX_GROUP_CONSTRAINTS = 12`
constraints per group. The layout follows the project SoA convention.

```text
groups:              Vec<ConstraintGroup>
group_atoms:         Vec<u32>             # length = sum of group.atom_count
group_constraints:   Vec<GroupConstraint> # length = sum of group.constraint_count
particle_count:      usize
```

Each `ConstraintGroup` is one connected component of the constraint
graph — a set of atoms made rigid by a set of pairwise distance
constraints. Each group carries:

- `atom_offset: u32` — start index into `group_atoms`.
- `atom_count: u32` — number of atoms in the group.
- `constraint_offset: u32` — start index into `group_constraints`.
- `constraint_count: u32` — number of constraints in the group.
- `constraint_type_index: u32` — index into the config's
  `[[constraint_types]]` array.

The atoms of group `g` are
`group_atoms[g.atom_offset .. g.atom_offset + g.atom_count]`. The atom
order within a group is the order in which atoms appear in the
`[constraints]` row that declared the group; the named constraint
type's `[[constraint_types]]` entry references atoms by their position
in this order via its `constraints` table. The constraint-row order
is preserved verbatim so that algorithms can rely on it; the per-group
sort within `groups` (see *Group Ordering* below) is separate.

The constraints of group `g` are
`group_constraints[g.constraint_offset .. g.constraint_offset + g.constraint_count]`.
Each `GroupConstraint` is `{ local_i: u8, local_j: u8, r0: f32 }`,
where `local_i` and `local_j` are indices into the group's atom slice
(so `0..g.atom_count`) and `r0` is the constraint distance in Bohr
(`a_0`).
Local indices restrict any single group to at most 256 atoms — sufficient
for all known SHAKE and M-SHAKE clusters; LINCS-class systems use a
different layout outside this framework.

Each group's algorithm is determined by looking up
`constraint_types[group.constraint_type_index]` (a `NamedSlotConfig`
from `io/config-schema.md`), then resolving the entry's `kind`
string against the `ConstraintRegistry` to obtain the registered
builder. The framework never tracks the algorithm tag separately —
the kind string carried by the config entry is the single source of
truth, and consumers (the topology parser, the `Constraint` slot
constructor, the registry) all resolve it the same way.

### Group Ordering <!-- rq-38199bd4 -->

`groups` is sorted by the minimum particle index each group contains.
The sort is total: every group's atom set is disjoint from every other
group's atom set (the parser rejects overlap), so the minimum-index
key is unique. Group ordering is therefore identical across runs from
identical inputs — required for the bit-wise reproducibility invariant.

`group_atoms` and `group_constraints` are stored in the same `groups`
order, so a kernel that assigns one thread per group reads consecutive
slices of both flat buffers.

### Implicit Exclusions from Constraint Groups <!-- rq-fdac1afb -->

Every intra-group atom pair is added to the effective `ExclusionList`
as `scale_lj = scale_coul = 0.0` unless an explicit `[exclusions]` row
covers that pair. The intra-group pairs include:

- Every constraint pair `(local_i, local_j)` listed in the group's
  `group_constraints` slice (the 1-2 pairs).
- Every other pair drawn from the group's atom set (1-3 and
  higher-order pairs reachable through chains of constraints inside
  the group).

For a SHAKE-constrained rigid-water group with atoms `(O, H1, H2)`,
the implicit exclusions are `(O, H1)`, `(O, H2)`, and `(H1, H2)`.

These implicit exclusions are merged into the `ExclusionList` returned
by `load_topology_file` (see `forces/topology.md`). The precedence
rules match the existing bond- and angle-derived implicit-exclusion
behaviour: an explicit `[exclusions]` entry overrides the implicit
default for that pair.

## Constraint-Type Validation <!-- rq-402cea33 -->

Per-group shape validation lives on the `ConstraintBuilder` trait
(see *Feature API* below). When `ConstraintRegistry::build_optional`
constructs the slot, it iterates the `ConstraintList`'s groups, looks
up each group's algorithm via
`constraint_types[group.constraint_type_index].kind`, and calls the
matching builder's `validate_group_shape(...)` before partitioning the
list and delegating to `build(...)` (see *Slot Composition* below).
The topology parser also calls the builder's
`expected_atom_count(&params)` to size-check `[constraints]` rows.

Per-builder shape rules are documented in each algorithm's
requirements file. For SHAKE (see `shake.md`):

- `expected_atom_count(&params)` deserialises the named constraint
  type's `params` as `ShakeParams` and returns `params.atoms as usize`.
- `validate_group_shape(...)` requires that the group's atom count
  equals the declared `atoms` field of the constraint type, that the
  group's constraint count equals the length of the type's
  `constraints` list, and that both counts fit within
  `MAX_GROUP_ATOMS = 8` and `MAX_GROUP_CONSTRAINTS = 12`. The
  constraint pairs (`local_i`, `local_j`) and the per-constraint `r0`
  values come from the named constraint type's `constraints` table,
  not from the topology file.

Shape-mismatch failures surface as
`ConstraintError::InvalidGroupShape { group_index, kind, reason }`
where `kind` is the algorithm's kind string.

## Slot Composition <!-- rq-9be2f56a -->

A topology may declare constraint groups whose algorithm kinds are not
all the same — e.g. SHAKE for general rigid clusters alongside
analytical SETTLE for specialised three-atom water groups.
`ConstraintRegistry::build_optional` partitions the topology across
the registered builders so that each builder constructs a slot
covering only the groups it owns.

The partition is driven by the registry's builder order:

1. Iterate `self.builders` in registration order.
2. For each builder, collect the indices of every group `g` in
   `list.groups` whose
   `constraint_types[g.constraint_type_index].kind` equals the
   builder's `kind_name()`.
3. If the collected index set is non-empty, construct a sub-list via
   `ConstraintList::subset(&self, group_indices: &[usize])` and call
   the builder's `build(...)` with that sub-list. The sub-list shares
   `particle_count` with the original, stores global atom indices in
   `group_atoms` unchanged, and continues to reference the original
   `constraint_types` array through each group's
   `constraint_type_index`.
4. If the collected index set is empty, skip the builder. No slot is
   constructed for builders with no groups in this topology.

The fan-out produces:

- Zero slots when `list.is_empty()` → `Ok(None)`.
- One slot when exactly one builder contributed → `Ok(Some(slot))`,
  where `slot` is the builder's bare output.
- Two or more slots when multiple builders contributed →
  `Ok(Some(composite))`, where `composite` wraps the contributing
  slots in registration order and forwards each `Constraint` trait
  method call to every wrapped slot in that order.

The composite wrapper is a private implementation detail. Callers
receive `Box<dyn Constraint>` regardless of whether one slot or
several are inside it. The composite's `group_count()` is the sum of
its wrapped slots' counts.

Each composite hook propagates the first inner-slot `Err` it
encounters and does not call subsequent slots. The runner's error
handling does not distinguish a composite from a single slot.

Two builders registered under the same `kind_name()` are not detected:
the first one in registration order receives every matching group; the
second receives an empty index set and contributes no slot.

## Feature API <!-- rq-6f8f049b -->

### Types <!-- rq-289ab328 -->

- `Constraint` — object-safe trait implemented by every concrete <!-- rq-ca6db610 -->
  constraint slot.

  ```rust
  pub trait Constraint: std::fmt::Debug + Send {
      fn apply_before_drift(
          &mut self,
          buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers,
          sim_box: &SimulationBox,
          dt: f32,
          timings: &mut Timings,
      ) -> Result<(), ConstraintError>;

      fn apply_after_drift(
          &mut self,
          buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers,
          sim_box: &SimulationBox,
          dt: f32,
          timings: &mut Timings,
      ) -> Result<(), ConstraintError>;

      fn apply_after_kick(
          &mut self,
          buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers,
          sim_box: &SimulationBox,
          dt: f32,
          timings: &mut Timings,
      ) -> Result<(), ConstraintError>;

      /// Project positions back onto the constraint manifold without
      /// modifying velocities, virials, or any other buffer.
      /// Driven by the minimization runner (see
      /// `rqm/minimization/steepest-descent.md`); never called from the
      /// integration plan walk.
      fn apply_position_projection_only(
          &mut self,
          buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers,
          sim_box: &SimulationBox,
          timings: &mut Timings,
      ) -> Result<(), ConstraintError>;
  }
  ```

  - Every hook returns `Ok(())` immediately when the slot owns zero
    constraint groups.
  - Hooks never modify `force_field` or `sim_box` and never read or
    write `buffers.forces_*` or `buffers.potential_energies`.
  - `apply_before_drift` is permitted to mutate slot-private buffers
    only; `buffers` is borrowed mutably for symmetry with the other
    hooks and to allow future hooks that need to mutate state.
  - `apply_after_kick` is permitted to mutate `buffers.virials` to
    add the constraint slot's contribution to the total scalar
    virial used by the barostat's pressure estimate. The
    contribution is *added* (not assigned): each constraint slot
    adds in-place, so the force evaluation that runs between
    `apply_after_drift` and `apply_after_kick` populates virials
    first and the constraint contribution is folded in afterward.
    Concrete algorithms document the exact form of their
    contribution (see `shake.md` for the two-half decomposition:
    a position-level `m · Δr · r / dt²` part from the SHAKE
    projection plus a velocity-level `m · Δv · r / dt` part from
    the RATTLE projection).
  - `apply_position_projection_only` mutates only
    `buffers.positions_*`. It does not touch `buffers.velocities_*`,
    `buffers.virials`, `buffers.forces_*`, or `sim_box`, and it does
    not consume `dt` (minimization has no physical time scale). It
    is permitted to read and write slot-private scratch buffers. The
    runner invokes it after each trial position update inside the
    SD loop (see `rqm/minimization/steepest-descent.md`'s *Algorithm*
    step 2); the integrator plan walk never calls it.

- `ConstraintGroup` — `Debug, Clone, Copy`. Fields: `atom_offset: u32`, <!-- rq-0faddd62 -->
  `atom_count: u32`, `constraint_offset: u32`, `constraint_count: u32`,
  `constraint_type_index: u32`.

- `GroupConstraint` — `Debug, Clone, Copy`. Fields: `local_i: u8`, <!-- rq-f28b82a7 -->
  `local_j: u8`, `r0: f32`. Invariant: `local_i < local_j`.

- `ConstraintList` — host-side parsed-and-validated constraint data. <!-- rq-b6f167a4 -->
  Fields:
  - `groups: Vec<ConstraintGroup>`
  - `group_atoms: Vec<u32>`
  - `group_constraints: Vec<GroupConstraint>`
  - `particle_count: usize`

  Methods:

  - `ConstraintList::is_empty(&self) -> bool` —
    `self.groups.is_empty()`.
  - `ConstraintList::subset(&self, group_indices: &[usize]) -> ConstraintList`
    — returns a fresh `ConstraintList` containing only the groups at
    the supplied indices, in the order supplied. The returned list's
    `groups[k]` has `atom_offset` and `constraint_offset` relabeled
    into the sub-list's own SoA arrays; `atom_count`,
    `constraint_count`, and `constraint_type_index` are copied from
    the source group unchanged. `group_atoms` continues to store
    global atom indices (no remapping into the subset). `particle_count`
    equals the source list's `particle_count`. `group_indices` may be
    empty, producing an empty list with the source's `particle_count`
    preserved. Indices outside `0..self.groups.len()` cause a panic;
    the caller is expected to derive `group_indices` from a walk of
    `self.groups`.

  Each group's algorithm is resolved at consume time from
  `constraint_types[group.constraint_type_index].kind` (the
  `NamedSlotConfig`'s `kind` string), not stored on the list itself.

- `ConstraintRegistry` — host-side registry of constraint builders. <!-- rq-3cca2cb1 -->
  Holds `builders: Vec<Box<dyn ConstraintBuilder>>`.

  Methods:

  - `ConstraintRegistry::with_builtins() -> ConstraintRegistry` —
    constructs a registry pre-populated with the builders for every
    `kind` value in the table above. In v1 this is the single `shake`
    builder.
  - `ConstraintRegistry::register(&mut self, builder: Box<dyn ConstraintBuilder>)`
    — appends a builder. Two builders sharing the same `kind_name()`
    are not detected at registration; the lookup returns the first
    match.
  - `ConstraintRegistry::lookup(&self, kind: &str) -> Option<&dyn ConstraintBuilder>`
    — returns the first registered builder whose `kind_name()` equals
    `kind`. The topology parser uses this to call
    `expected_atom_count(&params)` per constraint-type entry; the
    runner uses it to drive `validate_params` and
    `validate_group_shape` at config-validation time.
  - `ConstraintRegistry::build_optional(&self, list: &ConstraintList, gpu: &GpuContext, particle_count: usize, masses: &[f32], constraint_types: &[NamedSlotConfig]) -> Result<Option<Box<dyn Constraint>>, ConstraintError>`
    — when `list.is_empty()`, returns `Ok(None)`. Otherwise verifies
    that every group's algorithm has a registered builder (returns
    `ConstraintError::UnsupportedKind(kind)` for the first unmatched
    kind), runs every group through its builder's
    `validate_group_shape(...)`, then fans out across builders per
    *Slot Composition* above. Returns a bare slot when exactly one
    builder contributes; returns the private composite wrapper when
    two or more contribute. Slot-firing order follows the registry's
    builder registration order.

- `ConstraintBuilder` — trait describing a registered constraint <!-- rq-7896e33a -->
  implementation. Implementations are stateless and self-register at
  construction time.

  - `validate_params` is a pure function of the supplied parameters
    and must not allocate device memory.
  - `expected_atom_count` is also a pure function of the supplied
    parameters. SHAKE returns `params.atoms` from the deserialised
    `ShakeParams`.
  - `validate_group_shape` runs before `build` and surfaces
    algorithm-specific cluster-shape errors as
    `ConstraintError::InvalidGroupShape`. `validate_group_shape` runs
    against every group the builder will own; `build` is then called
    once with the sub-list containing those groups.
  - `build` constructs the device-side slot from the sub-list it
    receives. A builder whose group set is empty is not called at all.

- `ConstraintError` — error type returned by every trait method. <!-- rq-feb0501c -->
  Variants:
  - `Gpu(GpuError)` — CUDA driver / kernel-launch failure.
  - `Timings(TimingsError)` — CUDA event recording failure.
  - `UnsupportedKind(String)` — the registry has no builder for the
    requested algorithm kind. The string is the unresolved `kind`
    from the corresponding `NamedSlotConfig`.
  - `UnknownConstraintType(String)` — the `[constraints]` row
    references a constraint-type name that does not appear in the
    config's `[[constraint_types]]` array.
  - `DuplicateConstraintAtom { atom: u32 }` — two constraint rows
    share an atom (forbidden in v1; clusters are disjoint).
  - `InvalidGroupShape { group_index: usize, kind: String, reason: String }`
    — the parsed group does not satisfy the algorithm's required
    cluster shape (atom count, constraint pattern, etc.).
  - `ConstraintBondPairOverlap { atom_i: u32, atom_j: u32 }` — an
    `(atom_i, atom_j)` pair is named both in `[bonds]` and (after
    expansion of constraint groups into their pairwise constraints)
    in `[constraints]`.

  The runner's `RunnerError` wraps the type via
  `RunnerError::Constraint(ConstraintError)`.

- `ConstraintCapableIntegrator` — supertrait of `Integrator`. Marks <!-- rq-ab8c77bc -->
  types whose `StepPlan` shape is compatible with the constraint
  slot's hook positions and carries the runtime-state predicate that
  decides whether a specific instance currently accepts hook
  installation.

  ```rust
  pub trait ConstraintCapableIntegrator: Integrator {
      /// Runtime check: does this integrator instance currently
      /// accept constraint-hook installation? `Ok(())` accepts;
      /// `Err(reason)` rejects with a human-readable explanation
      /// that propagates into
      /// `StepError::IntegratorRejectsConstraint`. The default
      /// returns `Ok(())`.
      fn check_accepts_constraints_now(&self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
          Ok(())
      }
  }
  ```

  Default-registry implementations:

  - `VelocityVerletState` implements `ConstraintCapableIntegrator`.
    Its `check_accepts_constraints_now` returns `Ok(())` when the
    instance was constructed with `lossless = false`; otherwise it
    returns `Err("velocity-Verlet in lossless mode does not yet
    support constraints")`.
  - `LangevinBaoabState` and `MtkNptIntegrator` do not implement
    `ConstraintCapableIntegrator`. Attempting to call
    `step_with_constraint` on either is a compile-time error.

- `IntegratorStepExt` — blanket convenience trait implemented for <!-- rq-1ac78590 -->
  every `Integrator`. Drives a one-shot plan walk with no constraint
  hooks.

  ```rust
  pub trait IntegratorStepExt {
      fn step(
          &mut self,
          buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers,
          sim_box: &mut SimulationBox,
          force_field: &mut ForceField,
          dt: f32,
          timings: &mut Timings,
      ) -> Result<(), StepError>;
  }

  impl<T: Integrator + ?Sized> IntegratorStepExt for T { /* … */ }
  ```

  `step` calls `run_step(self, …, install_constraint_hooks: false,
  …)` with no `Constraint` slot. The runner uses the lower-level
  `run_step` directly and does not depend on this trait.

- `IntegratorStepWithConstraintExt` — convenience trait whose blanket <!-- rq-f71ff87f -->
  impl is bounded on `Self: ConstraintCapableIntegrator`. Drives a
  one-shot plan walk with the constraint slot installed.

  ```rust
  pub trait IntegratorStepWithConstraintExt {
      fn step_with_constraint(
          &mut self,
          buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers,
          sim_box: &mut SimulationBox,
          force_field: &mut ForceField,
          constraint: &mut dyn Constraint,
          dt: f32,
          timings: &mut Timings,
      ) -> Result<(), StepError>;
  }

  impl<T: ConstraintCapableIntegrator + ?Sized> IntegratorStepWithConstraintExt
      for T
  { /* … */ }
  ```

  `step_with_constraint` first calls
  `self.check_accepts_constraints_now()`; if that returns
  `Err(reason)`, the method returns
  `StepError::IntegratorRejectsConstraint { reason }` without
  dispatching `plan()`, `execute()`, or any kernel. Otherwise it
  calls `run_step(self, …, install_constraint_hooks: true,
  Some(constraint), …)`.

- `StepError` — unified error type returned by `run_step` and both <!-- rq-52e52d7b -->
  convenience-trait methods. Defined in `src/integrator/mod.rs`.
  Variants:

  - `Integrator(IntegratorError)` — wraps an integrator sub-step
    failure from `Integrator::execute`.
  - `ForceField(ForceFieldError)` — wraps a force-evaluation failure
    from `force_field.step(...)` / `force_field.step_class(...)`.
  - `Constraint(ConstraintError)` — wraps a failure from any
    `Constraint` trait method (hooks fired by `run_step`).
  - `IntegratorRejectsConstraint { reason: &'static str }` — returned
    by `IntegratorStepWithConstraintExt::step_with_constraint` when
    `check_accepts_constraints_now()` returns `Err(reason)`. The
    `reason` string is the integrator's verbatim rejection message
    (see the trait's documentation).

### Functions and Methods <!-- rq-dfd47225 -->

- `IntegratorBuilder::supports_constraints(&self, params: &toml::Value) -> bool` <!-- rq-9331ede2 -->
  — defined on the `IntegratorBuilder` trait (see `framework.md`).
  Returns `true` for builders whose integrator drives the three
  `Constraint` hooks. Default-registry returns:
  - `"velocity-verlet"` builder with `params.lossless == false` →
    `true`.
  - `"velocity-verlet"` builder with `params.lossless == true` →
    `false`.
  - `"langevin-baoab"` builder → `false` (regardless of `params`).
  - `"mtk-npt"` builder → `false` (regardless of `params`).

- `ConstraintRegistry::build_optional(&self, list: &ConstraintList, gpu: &GpuContext, particle_count: usize, masses: &[f32], constraint_types: &[NamedSlotConfig]) -> Result<Option<Box<dyn Constraint>>, ConstraintError>` <!-- rq-b004196f -->
  — as described above.

- `Constraint::apply_before_drift`, `Constraint::apply_after_drift`, <!-- rq-e538c545 -->
  `Constraint::apply_after_kick` — as described above. Each returns
  `Ok(())` without launching any kernel when the slot's group count
  is zero.

## Construction and Lifetime <!-- rq-2523992c -->

The runner constructs the constraint slot immediately after building
the integrator, thermostat, and barostat slots. Construction draws
from the `ConstraintList` returned by `load_topology_file`:

```rust
let constraint = ConstraintRegistry::with_builtins()
    .build_optional(
        &constraint_list,
        &gpu,
        particle_count,
        &masses,
        &config.constraint_types,
    )?;
```

The slot's per-group device buffers are allocated on the runner's
`Arc<CudaDevice>` inside the builder. All allocations persist for the
lifetime of the run and are dropped together with the rest of the
runner's GPU resources at end of run.

## Empty State <!-- rq-c491802b -->

When the runner has `particle_count == 0`, every constraint hook
returns `Ok(())` without launching any kernel. The slot's allocations
may have zero-length device slices but the builder must construct
successfully. An empty `ConstraintList` always yields `None` from
`build_optional`.

## Determinism Guarantees <!-- rq-9fe1d656 -->

The constraint framework preserves the project's bit-wise
reproducibility invariant on the same GPU under the conditions each
algorithm individually guarantees:

- All constraint kernels run on the default stream of the same
  `Arc<CudaDevice>` carried by `ParticleBuffers`. No additional
  streams are introduced.
- The intra-step hook order (`apply_before_drift`, then drift, then
  `apply_after_drift`, then force evaluation, then kick, then
  `apply_after_kick`) is fixed and identical across runs.
- Group order in the device-side group buffers matches `groups` in
  the host-side `ConstraintList`, which is sorted by each group's
  minimum particle index. Two independently-constructed
  `ConstraintList`s from identical inputs are byte-identical, and
  every kernel that consumes them processes groups in the same order.
- Slot-firing order under the private composite wrapper is the
  registration order of the contributing builders. Two runs that
  construct `ConstraintRegistry` identically (e.g. both via
  `with_builtins()`) see byte-identical slot-firing order. The order
  is load-bearing because slots' `apply_after_kick` hooks accumulate
  into `buffers.virials` in-place via floating-point `+=`.
- Concrete algorithms (SHAKE in the default registry) document the
  fixed-order per-group computation that produces bit-identical
  outputs across runs on the same GPU.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-acb86c9b -->

- Concrete constraint algorithms other than SHAKE. Analytical SETTLE
  (Miyamoto-Kollman) for three-atom rigid water and M-SHAKE for
  rigid clusters above the SHAKE per-group caps are the targets of
  follow-up constraint features and share this framework's data
  layout, trait, and dispatch. LINCS-class global constraint solvers
  require a different layout and are not anticipated by this
  framework.
- Composing constraints with `velocity-verlet { lossless: true }`,
  with `langevin-baoab`, or with `mtk-npt`. Each is rejected at
  config load via the
  `IntegratorBuilder::supports_constraints(&params)` predicate.
  Lossless support is the target of a follow-up feature that designs
  how constraint corrections fold into the `(f32 high, f64 low)`
  compensated sum.
- Cluster building that merges constraint rows sharing atoms. Each
  row in `[constraints]` is its own group in v1; the parser rejects
  overlap. The connected-components algorithm needed to merge shared
  atoms across rows arrives with M-SHAKE.
- Constraint diagnostics beyond config-load validation (per-step
  residual reporting, per-group iteration counts). SHAKE writes its
  position-level residual into a buffer that is bit-reproducible but
  not exposed to log output; future diagnostics features may surface
  it.
- Mid-run replacement of the constraint slot. The slot is fixed at
  construction and never replaced for the duration of a run.
- User-defined constraint algorithms via a DSL. New algorithms are
  added as Rust source files implementing the `Constraint` trait and
  registering a `ConstraintBuilder`.

    And a ConstraintList of two SHAKE groups
    When registry.build_optional(...) is called
    Then it returns Ok(Some(slot))
    And slot.group_count() == 2

  @rq-135a6e30
  Scenario: Two registered kinds on a mixed-kind topology fan out
    Given a ConstraintRegistry that registers a SHAKE builder, then a recording stub builder under kind = "stub"
    And a ConstraintList of two SHAKE groups and one "stub"-kind group
    When registry.build_optional(...) is called
    Then it returns Ok(Some(composite))
    And the SHAKE builder.build() received a sub-list whose group_count == 2
    And the stub builder.build() received a sub-list whose group_count == 1
    And composite.group_count() == 3

  @rq-08ece93d
  Scenario: Slot-firing order under the composite matches registration order
    Given a registry that registers recording stub builder A under kind = "alpha", then recording stub builder B under kind = "beta"
    And a ConstraintList containing one alpha-kind group and one beta-kind group
    When the resulting slot's apply_after_drift is invoked once
    Then A.apply_after_drift fires before B.apply_after_drift
    And reversing the registration order so that B is registered before A reverses the firing order

  Scenario: Empty bucket for a registered kind skips its builder
    Given a registry that registers a SHAKE builder and a recording stub builder under kind = "stub"
    And a ConstraintList of two SHAKE groups and zero "stub"-kind groups
    When registry.build_optional(...) is called
    Then the stub builder's build() is not called
    And the returned slot's group_count() == 2

  @rq-82cf45a2
  Scenario: Composite hook short-circuits on the first inner-slot error
    Given a registry that registers recording stub builder A, then recording stub builder B, both under distinct kinds
    And A.apply_after_drift is configured to return Err(...)
    And a ConstraintList containing one A-kind group and one B-kind group
    When the resulting slot's apply_after_drift is invoked once
    Then it returns Err(...) propagated from A
    And B.apply_after_drift is not called

  Scenario: ConstraintList::subset preserves global atom indices and particle_count
    Given a ConstraintList with particle_count == 100 and three groups whose group_atoms slices are [12, 14, 17], [90, 91, 92], [50, 51, 52]
    When list.subset(&[1]) is called
    Then the returned sub-list has particle_count == 100
    And the returned sub-list's group_atoms equals [90, 91, 92]
    And the returned sub-list has groups.len() == 1
    And the returned sub-list's groups[0].atom_offset == 0
    And the returned sub-list's groups[0].atom_count == 3
    And the returned sub-list's groups[0].constraint_type_index equals the source group's constraint_type_index

  @rq-721e0fdb
  Scenario: ConstraintList::subset with empty indices yields an empty list
    Given any ConstraintList with particle_count == 100
    When list.subset(&[]) is called
    Then the returned sub-list satisfies is_empty()
    And the returned sub-list's group_atoms is empty
    And the returned sub-list's group_constraints is empty
    And the returned sub-list's particle_count == 100

  @rq-3c6753bc
  Scenario: ConstraintList::subset preserves the supplied index order
    Given a ConstraintList with three groups whose group_atoms slices are [10], [20], [30]
    When list.subset(&[2, 0]) is called
    Then the returned sub-list's groups[0] corresponds to the source's groups[2]
    And the returned sub-list's groups[1] corresponds to the source's groups[0]
    And the returned sub-list's group_atoms equals [30, 10]

    Given a VelocityVerletState constructed with lossless=true
    And a recording Constraint slot
    When integrator.step_with_constraint(buffers, sim_box, force_field, &mut slot, dt, timings) is called
