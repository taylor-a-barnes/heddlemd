# Feature: Berendsen Weak-Coupling Thermostat <!-- rq-25f24b26 -->

The Berendsen weak-coupling thermostat (Berendsen et al., *J. Chem.
Phys.* **81**, 3684 (1984)) is a deterministic NVT-like temperature
coupling. One of the pluggable thermostat slots (see `framework.md`);
selected by `kind = "berendsen"` in the config's `[thermostat]`
section.

The thermostat runs once per timestep, after the integrator's
post-step state is published, as a post-only hook (`apply_post`). Its
`apply_pre` is the default no-op. Every velocity is multiplied by a
global scalar `λ` chosen to relax the instantaneous temperature
toward the user-specified target temperature over a coupling time
`τ`. The rescale preserves centre-of-mass momentum exactly. The
thermostat carries no RNG state and produces byte-identical
trajectories across runs on the same GPU.

> **Caveat: Berendsen does NOT sample the canonical ensemble.** The
> coupling proportionally rescales all velocities each step, but
> uniform rescaling does not redistribute energy between the centre-
> of-mass mode and the internal modes. Over long runs this produces
> the "flying ice cube" pathology — kinetic energy concentrates in
> COM modes, and the temperature distribution narrows below the
> equipartition value. Use Berendsen for **equilibration only**.
> For canonical-ensemble production runs, use one of the
> ensemble-correct alternatives in the registry: `csvr`,
> `nose-hoover-chain`, `andersen`, or the fused `langevin-baoab`
> integrator.

## Algorithm <!-- rq-adba6f8a -->

The thermostat is invoked through `apply_post(buffers, dt, timings)`
after the integrator's `step()` returns. The integrator has already
completed its velocity-Verlet substeps; the thermostat operates on
the post-step velocities. For each invocation with timestep `dt`:

1. Compute the instantaneous kinetic energy `K_old` via the shared
   `compute_kinetic_energy` helper (`nose-hoover-chain.md`).
2. Compute the rescale factor

   ```text
   K_target = (N_f / 2) · T          # k_B = 1 in atomic units; T carries
                                     # k_B · T (Hartrees)
   λ² = 1 + (dt / τ) · (K_target / K_old − 1)
   λ  = sqrt(max(λ², 0))
   ```

   where `N_f = max(1, 3·N − n_constraints − 3)` is the number of
   thermostatted degrees of freedom (constraint- and COM-removed; the
   same convention used by CSVR — see `csvr.md` — and by
   `compute_temperature` in `io/log-output.md`). The `max(λ², 0)`
   floor handles the rare case
   where `dt / τ > 1` and `K_target ≪ K_old` would produce a
   negative `λ²`; clamping to zero quenches the velocities rather
   than producing imaginary numbers. Sensible parameters
   (`dt / τ ≤ 0.1`) never hit the floor.

The compute of `λ²` and `λ` runs entirely device-side as part of
step 2's kernel (see *Per-Step Kernel Sequence* below). The host
never downloads `K_old`.

3. Apply the rescale via the JIT-composed post-force per-particle
   kernel: `v_i ← λ · v_i` for every particle `i` and axis.
   `apply_post` itself does not launch a per-particle rescale;
   Berendsen's source fragment carries the
   `v *= berendsen_factor_device[0]` body that the composed kernel
   inlines per thread.

4. Update the running
   `cumulative_injection += K_old · (λ² − 1)`. The accumulator
   update happens on the device in the same kernel that writes
   `factor_device`; the host drains the device accumulator on the
   `flush_pending_injection` cadence the runner imposes before
   each log row.

When `K_old = 0` on entry (every velocity exactly zero, e.g. a
freshly-initialised system before the first force-driven kick), the
formula for `λ²` divides by zero. The device kernel detects this
and writes `factor_device = 1` (no rescale) and a zero injection
delta for that invocation. The next integrator step's
velocity-Verlet kick produces non-zero `K` and the thermostat
resumes.

`apply_pre` is the trait default (no-op): Berendsen is a post-only
weak-coupling formula and never modifies velocities before the
integrator runs.

## Per-Step Kernel Sequence <!-- rq-dd953328 -->

Per timestep the Berendsen thermostat's `apply_post` runs the
following in fixed order:

| Order | Step              | Kernel / call                                     | Operation                                                                     | Stage label                  |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1     | KE reduce         | `compute_kinetic_energy_on_device`                | writes `ke_scratch` device buffer; no dtoh                                    | `KineticEnergyReduce`        |
| 2     | Compute factor    | `berendsen_compute_factor`                        | reads `ke_scratch` + slot scalars; writes `factor_device` and accumulator delta | `BerendsenComputeFactor`     |
| 3     | Velocity rescale  | composed post-force per-particle kernel           | `v ← λ · v` per particle                                                       | `JitComposedPostForce`       |

Steps 1 and 2 run inside `apply_post`. Step 3 runs from the
JIT-composed post-force per-particle kernel via Berendsen's source
fragment. `compute_kinetic_energy_on_device` is reused from
`csvr.md`. `berendsen_compute_factor` is a single-thread device
kernel owned by this slot that takes `ke_scratch`, `kT_target`,
`g_dof`, `dt / τ`, and the cumulative-injection accumulator
pointer, and writes the rescale factor `λ` plus the injection
delta.

The host-side work each step is one `f64` `λ` computation; cost is
negligible. The integrator's own kernels (`vv_kick_drift`, `vv_kick`,
the force pipeline) are launched separately by `integrator.step()`
and are not part of this slot's per-step sequence.

## Parameters <!-- rq-e3243e24 -->

The matching builder deserialises a typed `BerendsenParams` from the `[thermostat]` section's `SlotConfig::params` (see `framework.md`); the per-field reference below documents that parameter struct:

- `temperature: f64` — bath temperature `T` as `k_B · T` in Hartrees
  (the engine's internal temperature representation; `k_B = 1`).
  Required.
  Finite and strictly positive. Independent of
  `simulation.temperature`, which governs the initial-velocity
  sampler.
- `tau: f64` — thermostat coupling time in atomic time units
  (`hbar / E_h`). Required. Finite
  and strictly positive. Typical values for liquid water are 100 fs
  – 1 ps. Smaller `τ` couples more strongly (faster temperature
  relaxation, larger departure from NVE); larger `τ` leaves the
  dynamics closer to NVE.

No RNG seed: Berendsen is deterministic.

## Berendsen "conserved quantity" <!-- rq-0f81f83f -->

The diagnostic for Berendsen is

```text
H_berendsen = K + U − Σ_{invocations} (K_new − K_old)
```

i.e., the physical Hamiltonian plus a running subtraction of the
cumulative kinetic energy injected (or removed) by the rescale.
Because Berendsen is deterministic, this quantity drifts only by
`O(dt²)` per step (the velocity-Verlet integrator error), in
contrast to the martingale drift of the stochastic thermostats. A
systematic non-`O(dt²)` drift indicates an implementation bug.

`H_berendsen` is exposed as a per-log-row diagnostic column named
`berendsen_conserved` when Berendsen is the configured thermostat
(see `io/log-output.md`). The thermostat accumulates
`Σ (K_new − K_old)` on its host-side state across every
`apply_post` call, computed from `K_old` (kernel-reduced) and
`K_new = λ² · K_old` (host-computed).

## Empty State and degenerate cases <!-- rq-ed2ebeca -->

- `particle_count == 0`: `apply_pre` and `apply_post` return
  `Ok(())` without launching any kernel.
- `particle_count == 1` with `n_constraints == 0`:
  `N_f = max(1, 3 − 0 − 3) = 1`. The rescale works as documented; the
  system has one thermostatted degree of freedom.
- Heavily-constrained systems where `3·N − n_constraints − 3 <= 0`:
  the `max(1, …)` floor keeps `N_f = 1` so the thermostat still runs.
- `K_old == 0` on entry: rescale and accumulation are skipped this
  invocation.
- `dt / τ > 1` combined with `K_target ≪ K_old`: `λ²` is clamped to
  zero (quench).

## Feature API <!-- rq-ec1fc04e -->

### Types <!-- rq-ef1feb38 -->

- `BerendsenThermostat` — implements the `Thermostat` trait declared <!-- rq-f856f666 -->
  in `framework.md`. Registered in `ThermostatRegistry::with_builtins`
  under `kind_name() == "berendsen"`. Fields:

  - `device: Arc<CudaDevice>`
  - `temperature: f64`
  - `tau: f64`
  - `g_dof: u32` — `max(1, 3 · particle_count − n_constraints − 3)`,
    computed at construction from the `n_constraints` parameter
    passed by the runner.
  - `kt_target: f64` — equals `temperature` (the engine stores
    `k_B · T` in Hartrees directly; `k_B = 1`, so no Boltzmann
    constant appears).
  - `cumulative_injection: f64` — running sum of `K_new − K_old`
    across every completed `apply_post` invocation. Initialised to
    `0.0`. Used by `log_column_values`.
  - `ke_scratch: CudaSlice<f32>` — length-1 device buffer for the
    kinetic-energy reduction; reused across calls.
  - `most_recent_ke: f64` — last kinetic energy `K_new` computed
    during the current `apply_post` invocation.

  All fields private; the slot's public surface is the `Thermostat`
  trait methods and construction via `BerendsenBuilder`. The
  `cumulative_injection` and `most_recent_ke` fields are public for
  parity with the other registered thermostats so a future
  restart-from-checkpoint flow can restore them explicitly.

- `BerendsenBuilder` — implements `ThermostatBuilder` with <!-- rq-6c9037a4 -->
  `kind_name() == "berendsen"`. `build(device, particle_count, kind)`
  deserialises `BerendsenParams` from `params`, allocates the
  length-1 `ke_scratch` device buffer, and returns the boxed
  `BerendsenThermostat`.

### `Thermostat` trait overrides <!-- rq-46d980b2 -->

`BerendsenThermostat` overrides the diagnostic-column trait methods
declared in `framework.md`:

- `log_column_names() -> &'static ["berendsen_conserved"]`. <!-- rq-c908bbf1 -->
- `log_column_values(ke, pe) -> vec![ke + pe − cumulative_injection]`. <!-- rq-3589910b -->

`apply_pre` is left at its trait default (no-op).

### CUDA Kernels <!-- rq-2aadbec9 -->

Berendsen introduces no new CUDA kernels. It reuses
`kinetic_energy_reduce` and `rescale_velocities` from
`nose-hoover-chain.md` through their public launch helpers
`compute_kinetic_energy` and `rescale_velocities` re-exported from
`crate::gpu`.

## Launch Configuration <!-- rq-e2f03a25 -->

Per-step launch counts (per `apply_post` invocation):

- `kinetic_energy_reduce`: 1 launch (single block of 256 threads).
- `rescale_velocities`: 1 launch (block 256, grid `ceil(n/256)`).

All launches go through the default stream of
`ParticleBuffers::device`.

## Determinism <!-- rq-5e802037 -->

- Both kernels involved are deterministic by construction (see
  `nose-hoover-chain.md`).
- Berendsen carries no RNG; there are no stochastic draws to
  randomise.
- The host-side `λ` computation runs in `f64` from a single `f64`
  input (`K_old`) and the deterministic parameters; two runs produce
  byte-identical `λ` and therefore byte-identical post-step
  velocities.
- Two end-to-end runs composing the same integrator with Berendsen
  on the same GPU with identical configs and identical initial
  particle state produce byte-identical trajectory and log files,
  including the `berendsen_conserved` column.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-0076e6b4 -->

- A lossless `(f32, f64)` compensated mode. Berendsen is
  deterministic and time-reversibility under the integrator is not a
  property the algorithm promises.
- Per-type coupling times. The single `τ` applies to every particle
  regardless of species.
- Massive Berendsen (one independent coupling per atom). Single
  global thermostat only.
- A canonical-ensemble correction (e.g. Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello's
  stochastic version is exactly that and ships separately as
  `csvr`).
- A runtime warning when Berendsen is selected. The caveat lives in
  this requirements file and in the kind-field documentation in
  `config-schema.md`; the runner does not print a warning when
  loading a Berendsen config.
- Constraint algorithms (SHAKE/RATTLE).
- Pressure coupling (the Berendsen barostat is a separate
  `[barostat]` slot; see `framework.md`).
