# Feature: Velocity Verlet Time Integration <!-- rq-09a2e15f -->

Velocity Verlet is one of the integrators selected by the pluggable-slot
framework (see `framework.md`). It is the deterministic, symplectic
time-stepping core and is chosen via `kind = "velocity-verlet"` in the
`[integrator]` section of the config. Used standalone (no `[thermostat]`,
no `[barostat]`) the run is NVE; composed with any of the registered
thermostats it yields the corresponding NVT-flavoured run via the
framework's `apply_pre` / `apply_post` dispatch. The integrator itself
makes no thermostat or barostat decisions and does not own its
thermostat (the `"velocity-verlet"` builder's
`IntegratorBuilder::owns_thermostat(&params)` returns `false`).

The per-particle arithmetic is split across two CUDA kernels: `vv_kick_drift`
performs the first half-velocity update followed by the position update, and
`vv_kick` performs the second half-velocity update. The integrator declares a
three-element `StepPlan` (`KickDrift`, `ForceEval`, `KickHalf`) and the runner
walks it, dispatching `KickDrift` and `KickHalf` to `execute()` (which launches
the corresponding kernel) and `ForceEval` directly to `force_field.step(...)`
(see `framework.md`).

The integrator ships in two modes:

- **Lossy (default).** Uses ordinary IEEE-754 `f32` arithmetic. Each addition
  may discard low bits to rounding; the trajectory cannot be reversed
  bit-exactly.
- **Lossless.** Each per-particle quantity (positions and velocities) is
  augmented with an `f64` residual buffer that holds the bits the IEEE
  addition would otherwise discard. The lossless kernels carry out every
  update with `f64` intermediate precision so that the pair `(f32 high, f64
  low)` represents the running extended-precision sum to roughly `f64`
  precision. Because the algorithm is symmetric under negation, a forward
  run followed by a velocity-flip and another forward run of the same
  length restores the **observable** `f32` state — positions and velocities
  — bit-exactly. The `f64` residual buffers are internal compensation
  bookkeeping; they may drift by O(f64 ULP) per step under round-tripping
  but that drift never propagates into the observable `f32` state.

This feature covers the four CUDA kernels in `kernels/integrate.cu`, their PTX
loading via `init_device()`, the host-side `LosslessBuffers` struct, and the
Rust launch helpers that drive both modes.

## Algorithm <!-- rq-9f6a73f9 -->

Positions are kept wrapped into the primary image of the simulation
box: each particle's fractional coordinates lie in `[-1/2, 1/2)³` (see
`simulation-box.md`). The companion image triple
`(images_x[i], images_y[i], images_z[i])` records the number of lattice
vectors particle `i` has crossed along each of the three lattice
directions; the unwrapped position is
`wrapped + images_x[i] · a + images_y[i] · b + images_z[i] · c` (see
`particle-state.md`). The drift kernels enforce this invariant: after
updating positions, they wrap the result back into the primary image via
`SimulationBox::wrap_position_with_image_count` and advance the image
counter triple by the returned integer triple.

For each particle `i` with position `x_i`, velocity `v_i`, force `F_i`, and
mass `m_i`, a single timestep of size `dt` corresponds to:

1. `v_i ← v_i + (F_i / m_i) · (dt/2)`         (first half-kick)
2. `x_i ← x_i + v_i · dt`                      (drift; uses the half-step velocity)
3. force evaluation produces a fresh `F_i`
4. `v_i ← v_i + (F_i / m_i) · (dt/2)`         (second half-kick)

`vv_kick_drift` performs steps 1 and 2 in a single thread per particle. `vv_kick`
performs step 4. Step 3 is the force pipeline and is out of scope here.

Each particle's update depends only on its own state. There are no inter-thread
dependencies, no atomics, and no reductions. All four kernels are bit-wise
reproducible by construction: identical inputs yield byte-identical outputs.

### Lossless mode: compensated summation <!-- rq-580fe6f7 -->

In lossless mode, each scalar particle quantity that the integrator mutates
(positions and velocities, per axis) is represented as a `(high, low)` pair
where `high` is `f32` and `low` is `f64`. The extended-precision value
`high + low` (computed in `f64`) approximates the running sum to `f64`
precision. The lossless kernels promote every operand to `f64` for the
inner arithmetic and store the result back as a `(f32 high, f64 low)` pair
such that:

```
high + low ≈ exact_extended_precision_sum   // accurate to f64 precision
```

Concretely, an update `(buf, buf_lo) ← (buf, buf_lo) + delta` proceeds as:

```
extended = (f64) buf + buf_lo + (f64) delta   # all in f64
new_high = (f32) extended                     # IEEE round-to-nearest
new_low  = extended - (f64) new_high          # f64 remainder
```

The drift step in lossless `vv_kick_drift_lossless` uses the
extended-precision velocity `(v + v_lo)` so that the position update is
`x ← x + (v + v_lo) · dt`, decomposed into `(x_high_new, x_low_new)`.

The standard reversal protocol is:

1. Run forward integration for `N` steps to reach state `(x, x_lo, v, v_lo)`.
2. Negate every velocity component: `v ← -v`, `v_lo ← -v_lo`.
3. Run forward integration for `N` more steps with the same `dt`.
4. Negate velocity components again to restore direction.

Under this protocol, `positions_x/y/z` and `velocities_x/y/z` (the
observable `f32` arrays) return to their original byte-identical values on
the same GPU. The `f64` residual buffers may differ from their initial
contents by a small number of f64 ULPs per round-tripped step — that drift
is internal compensation that never propagates back into the observable
`f32` state, because residuals are bounded by the round-off slack of an
`f32` addition. In between forward and reverse runs, the force-evaluation
pipeline must be re-invoked at each step's intermediate position (just as
in the forward direction); forces themselves are deterministic functions of
positions so they do not require their own residuals.

## Feature API <!-- rq-74535c7a -->

### Types <!-- rq-33c0521d -->

- `LosslessBuffers` — host-side wrapper around the six device residual <!-- rq-303211d9 -->
  buffers used by the lossless integrator. All six `CudaSlice<f64>` fields
  are `pub` so the lossless launchers can pass them directly to kernel
  launches; carries an `Arc<CudaDevice>` and a private `particle_count`.

  Fields:
  - `device: Arc<CudaDevice>`
  - `positions_x_lo: CudaSlice<f64>`
  - `positions_y_lo: CudaSlice<f64>`
  - `positions_z_lo: CudaSlice<f64>`
  - `velocities_x_lo: CudaSlice<f64>`
  - `velocities_y_lo: CudaSlice<f64>`
  - `velocities_z_lo: CudaSlice<f64>`
  - private `particle_count: usize`

  Constructor:

  - `LosslessBuffers::new(device: Arc<CudaDevice>, particle_count: usize) -> Result<LosslessBuffers, GpuError>`
    - Allocates six `CudaSlice<f64>` of length `particle_count` via
      `CudaDevice::alloc_zeros`. Every residual starts at `0.0_f64`,
      meaning the initial extended-precision state is exactly the value
      held by the corresponding `ParticleBuffers` field.
    - A `particle_count` of zero is permitted and yields six length-zero
      device allocations.

  Accessor:

  - `LosslessBuffers::particle_count(&self) -> usize` — returns the value
    supplied at construction.

### CUDA Kernels <!-- rq-10cc8ddf -->

`kernels/integrate.cu` declares four `extern "C"` kernels:

```c
extern "C" __global__ void vv_kick_drift(
    float *positions_x, float *positions_y, float *positions_z,
    int *images_x, int *images_y, int *images_z,
    float *velocities_x, float *velocities_y, float *velocities_z,
    const float *forces_x, const float *forces_y, const float *forces_z,
    const float *masses,
    const float *lattice,           // length 6: [lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz]
    float dt,
    unsigned int n);

extern "C" __global__ void vv_kick(
    float *velocities_x, float *velocities_y, float *velocities_z,
    const float *forces_x, const float *forces_y, const float *forces_z,
    const float *masses,
    float dt,
    unsigned int n);

extern "C" __global__ void vv_kick_drift_lossless(
    float *positions_x, float *positions_y, float *positions_z,
    int *images_x, int *images_y, int *images_z,
    float *velocities_x, float *velocities_y, float *velocities_z,
    double *positions_x_lo, double *positions_y_lo, double *positions_z_lo,
    double *velocities_x_lo, double *velocities_y_lo, double *velocities_z_lo,
    const float *forces_x, const float *forces_y, const float *forces_z,
    const float *masses,
    const float *lattice,           // length 6: [lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz]
    float dt,
    unsigned int n);

extern "C" __global__ void vv_kick_lossless(
    float *velocities_x, float *velocities_y, float *velocities_z,
    double *velocities_x_lo, double *velocities_y_lo, double *velocities_z_lo,
    const float *forces_x, const float *forces_y, const float *forces_z,
    const float *masses,
    float dt,
    unsigned int n);
```

`vv_kick` and `vv_kick_lossless` update only velocities and so do not
touch `images_*` or take any lattice parameters. `vv_kick_drift` and
`vv_kick_drift_lossless` are the drift-bearing kernels that wrap
positions (via the triclinic *Wrap Algorithm* defined in
`simulation-box.md`) and advance image counts.

Each thread computes its global index as `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x`.
If the index is `>= n` the thread returns without touching any buffer.

The four kernel bodies share their per-particle math through a
`__device__` helper function templated on a `bool LOSSLESS` parameter.
`if constexpr (LOSSLESS)` selects between plain IEEE addition (lossy mode)
and the compensated `(high, low)` decomposition described in the algorithm
section. Each `extern "C"` wrapper instantiates the template with the
appropriate value:

```c
template <bool LOSSLESS>
__device__ inline void vv_kick_drift_body(
    unsigned int i, /* full argument list including residual pointers */);

extern "C" __global__ void vv_kick_drift(...)            { ... vv_kick_drift_body<false>(...); }
extern "C" __global__ void vv_kick_drift_lossless(...)   { ... vv_kick_drift_body<true>(...);  }
```

The lossy wrappers do not pass residual pointers and the lossless code
path is dead-code-eliminated by `if constexpr`, so the lossy kernels
incur no FLOP, register, or memory-traffic cost from the lossless
machinery.

Within `vv_kick_drift` (lossy), each thread performs in this order, on `f32`:

```
ax = forces_x[i] / masses[i]
ay = forces_y[i] / masses[i]
az = forces_z[i] / masses[i]
vx = velocities_x[i] + ax * (dt * 0.5f)
vy = velocities_y[i] + ay * (dt * 0.5f)
vz = velocities_z[i] + az * (dt * 0.5f)
velocities_x[i] = vx
velocities_y[i] = vy
velocities_z[i] = vz
px = positions_x[i] + vx * dt
py = positions_y[i] + vy * dt
pz = positions_z[i] + vz * dt
(positions_x[i], positions_y[i], positions_z[i], k_a, k_b, k_c)
    = wrap_position_with_image_count(px, py, pz, lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz)
images_x[i] += k_a
images_y[i] += k_b
images_z[i] += k_c
```

where `wrap_position_with_image_count` is the triclinic tilt-subtraction
wrap defined in `simulation-box.md`. The same formula is what
`SimulationBox::wrap_position_with_image_count` uses on the host. A
single update can cross any integer number of lattice vectors along
each direction; the integer triple `(k_a, k_b, k_c)` is always added to
the existing image counts so the unwrapped position
`wrapped + images_x · a + images_y · b + images_z · c` is invariant
under wrapping. For an orthorhombic box (`xy = xz = yz = 0`) this
reduces to three independent per-axis wraps.

Within `vv_kick` (lossy), each thread performs:

```
ax = forces_x[i] / masses[i]
ay = forces_y[i] / masses[i]
az = forces_z[i] / masses[i]
velocities_x[i] += ax * (dt * 0.5f)
velocities_y[i] += ay * (dt * 0.5f)
velocities_z[i] += az * (dt * 0.5f)
```

Within `vv_kick_drift_lossless`, each thread performs the algebraically
equivalent computation but with every velocity and position update done
via the compensated `(high, low)` decomposition described in the algorithm
section. The drift step uses `(v + v_lo)` (computed in the chosen
intermediate precision) when forming the position increment. After
rounding the post-drift `(high, low)` pair back into the canonical
form, the high halves are wrapped jointly via
`wrap_position_with_image_count` (which applies the lattice's six
parameters; see `simulation-box.md`) and the image counters are advanced
by the returned integer triple; the low halves are left unchanged by the
wrap (the rounding has already re-zeroed them within ULP).

Within `vv_kick_lossless`, each thread performs the velocity update via
the same compensated decomposition.

None of the four kernels writes to `forces_*` or to `masses`. The lossy
kernels do not read or write the residual buffers; the lossless kernels
read and write both the high and the low halves of the quantities they
mutate.

### PTX Module Loading <!-- rq-e20b2f39 -->

`init_device()` loads the compiled `kernels/integrate.cu` PTX as module
`"integrate"` and captures its `vv_kick_drift`, `vv_kick`,
`vv_kick_drift_lossless`, and `vv_kick_lossless` functions into the
`Kernels` handle (see `build-pipeline.md`).

### Rust Launch Helpers <!-- rq-581ec3ff -->

Four free functions live in `src/gpu/kernels.rs` and are re-exported from
`crate::gpu`:

- `vv_kick_drift(buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers, sim_box: &SimulationBox, dt: f32) -> Result<(), GpuError>` <!-- rq-f1ba909b -->
  - Launches the `vv_kick_drift` kernel using the device buffers carried
    by `buffers` and the lattice parameters read from `sim_box`.
  - Block size is 256; grid size is `ceil(buffers.particle_count() / 256)`.
  - When `buffers.particle_count() == 0`, returns `Ok(())` without launching a
    kernel.
  - Returns the underlying `GpuError` if the kernel launch fails.
  - Invokes the kernel through the `Kernels` handle reached from its
    arguments; it performs no string-keyed kernel lookup of its own (see
    `build-pipeline.md`).

- `vv_kick(buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers, dt: f32) -> Result<(), GpuError>` <!-- rq-f2e3fa58 -->
  - Same launch configuration and error/empty-state handling as `vv_kick_drift`.
  - Launches the `vv_kick` kernel. Does not consult `sim_box` because the
    velocity-only update never wraps positions.

- `vv_kick_drift_lossless(buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers, lossless: &mut LosslessBuffers, sim_box: &SimulationBox, dt: f32) -> Result<(), GpuError>` <!-- rq-7d5e87ee -->
  - Launches the `vv_kick_drift_lossless` kernel using both the
    `ParticleBuffers` (for `(high)` halves and image flags) and the
    `LosslessBuffers` (for `(low)` halves), with lattice parameters read from
    `sim_box`.
  - Same block/grid configuration and empty-state handling as the lossy
    variant; debug-asserts that `lossless.particle_count()` equals
    `buffers.particle_count()`.
  - Invokes the kernel through the `Kernels` handle, like the other
    launch helpers.

- `vv_kick_lossless(buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers, lossless: &mut LosslessBuffers, dt: f32) -> Result<(), GpuError>` <!-- rq-4ea8bbb2 -->
  - Same configuration and empty-state handling as `vv_kick_drift_lossless`.
  - Launches the `vv_kick_lossless` kernel. Does not consult `sim_box`.

None of the four helpers inspects mass values or constrains `dt`. NaN,
infinite, zero, or negative values flow through the kernel arithmetic and
produce corresponding NaN/Inf outputs.

The two velocity-only launchers (`vv_kick`, `vv_kick_lossless`) take no
`SimulationBox`; the two drift-bearing launchers (`vv_kick_drift`,
`vv_kick_drift_lossless`) require it for the wrap step. A run with
`lossless = false` never constructs a `LosslessBuffers` and pays no
memory or kernel-launch cost from the lossless code path.

## Slot Integration <!-- rq-39ab439e -->

`VelocityVerletState` implements the `Integrator` trait declared in
`framework.md`. The `velocity-verlet` builder registered in
`IntegratorRegistry::with_builtins()` deserialises a
`VelocityVerletParams { lossless: bool }` (with `lossless` defaulting
to `false` when omitted) from the `SlotConfig`'s `params: toml::Value`
and, when `lossless == true`, allocates a `LosslessBuffers` of the
runner's particle count on the same `Arc<CudaDevice>`.

The `"velocity-verlet"` builder's predicate methods (see
`integration/framework.md`):

- `validate_params(&params)` deserialises `VelocityVerletParams` from
  `params`, rejecting unknown fields with `ConfigError::Parse`.
- `owns_thermostat(&params)` and `owns_barostat(&params)` always
  return `false`.
- `supports_constraints(&params)` returns
  `!VelocityVerletParams::from(params).lossless` — `true` for the
  lossy variant, `false` for the lossless variant.

### Step Plan <!-- rq-a097b162 -->

`VelocityVerletState::plan(dt)` returns a fixed three-element plan:

```rust
StepPlan { steps: vec![
    SubStep::KickDrift { dt, label: "vv_kick_drift" },
    SubStep::ForceEval,
    SubStep::KickHalf  { dt, label: "vv_kick"       },
]}
```

The plan shape is identical for the lossy and lossless variants; the
`lossless` flag is carried on the integrator's `&mut self` and read
inside `execute()` to choose between the lossy and lossless kernels.

### Sub-step Execution <!-- rq-51e5a0cd -->

`VelocityVerletState::execute(sub, buffers, sim_box, timings)`
dispatches:

- `SubStep::KickDrift { dt, .. }` → launches `vv_kick_drift` (lossy) or
  `vv_kick_drift_lossless` (lossless), bracketed by
  `timings.kernel_start(KernelStage::VV_KICK_DRIFT)` /
  `timings.kernel_stop(KernelStage::VV_KICK_DRIFT)` (or the
  `*_LOSSLESS` stage names — see `performance-analysis.md`). Applies
  the first half-kick using the cached `F(t)` and drifts positions
  to `x(t+dt)`.
- `SubStep::KickHalf { dt, .. }` → launches `vv_kick` (lossy) or
  `vv_kick_lossless` (lossless) with matching timing bracketing.
  Applies the second half-kick using `F(t+dt)`.
- Any other variant → returns
  `IntegratorError::UnexpectedSubStep { variant: <name> }`. A
  conforming runner never produces this case: `ForceEval` is
  dispatched directly by the runner, and Velocity Verlet's plan
  contains no `Drift` or `Custom` sub-steps.

### Runner-Driven Constraint Hooks <!-- rq-9b03044f -->

The runner walks the plan (see `framework.md` and
`constraint-framework.md`). When a constraint slot is configured and
the `"velocity-verlet"` builder's
`IntegratorBuilder::supports_constraints(&params)` returns `true`,
the runner inserts `apply_before_drift` / `apply_after_drift` around
the `KickDrift` sub-step and fires `apply_after_kick` after the final
`KickHalf`. Velocity Verlet's `execute()` is unaware of the
constraint slot.

The builder's `supports_constraints(&params)` returns `true` when
`params.lossless == false` and `false` when `params.lossless == true`.
The config loader rejects the `lossless = true` + non-empty
`[constraints]` combination with `ConfigError::IncompatibleConstraint`
(see `integration/constraint-framework.md` and
`io/config-schema.md`).

`sim_box` is borrowed mutably during `execute()` but velocity-Verlet
does not modify it. Velocity Verlet is deterministic and stateless
across timesteps (beyond the particle buffers themselves); it
carries no per-call counter.

## Launch Configuration <!-- rq-0540b862 -->

- Block size: 256 threads.
- Grid size: `ceil(n / 256)` blocks in the x dimension.
- Shared memory: zero bytes.
- Stream: the default stream carried by `ParticleBuffers::device`.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-92f5e5c4 -->

- Force evaluation (pair force kernel, segmented reduction, neighbor lists).
- Higher-level orchestration of the timestep loop, including the
  input-file flag that selects between lossy and lossless mode at runtime
  (the simulation-loop feature owns the dispatch; this feature only
  provides the kernels and buffers).
- Other integrators (leapfrog, RK4, predictor-corrector).
- Thermostats and barostats. Velocity-Verlet composes with the
  `[thermostat]` and `[barostat]` slots through the framework's
  dispatch order; the registered thermostat / barostat
  implementations own their respective per-step state and kernels.
- The concrete constraint algorithms themselves. This file describes
  the integrator's three hook-call points; the constraint slot, its
  trait, and the SETTLE implementation live in
  `constraint-framework.md` and `settle.md`.
- Energy diagnostics and trajectory output.
- Numerical validation of inputs (zero/non-finite masses, dt sign).
- The `f64` precision feature flag for the *primary* particle state
  (the lossless kernels use `f64` only as an internal intermediate to
  compute the compensated decomposition; the public state remains `f32`
  pairs).
- Multi-stream or multi-GPU launches.
- Bit-reversibility under variable forces verified through the full
  force-evaluation pipeline. The lossless integrator kernels are
  reversibility-correct in isolation; whole-pipeline reversibility is the
  responsibility of a future end-to-end reversibility test that drives
  `lj_pair_force_f` between integrator calls.
