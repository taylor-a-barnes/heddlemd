# Feature: End-to-End Pipeline Reversibility Test <!-- rq-d836d884 -->

The lossless integrator carries a stronger guarantee than ordinary
reproducibility: a forward run followed by a velocity flip and another
forward run of the same length restores the observable `f32` state
(positions and velocities) bit-exactly on the same GPU. The per-kernel
reversibility scenarios in `integration.md` exercise this property under
zero or constant forces. This feature exercises it under a *position-
dependent* force field driven by the full Lennard-Jones force pipeline,
confirming that round-trip reversibility holds end-to-end through the
pair-force kernel and the segmented reduction.

The test lives in `tests/pipeline_reversibility.rs`. It introduces no new
public types or functions; it composes the existing `jit_composed_pair_force`,
`jit_composed_pair_force`, `vv_kick_drift_lossless`, and `vv_kick_lossless`
launchers around the existing `LosslessBuffers`.

A negative companion test in the same file confirms that the lossy
integrator does **not** preserve bit-exact reversibility under the same
protocol — establishing that the lossless residual machinery is what
buys the guarantee.

## Test Fixture <!-- rq-7600786b -->

The reversibility test reuses the perturbed Lennard-Jones lattice from
the pipeline-reproducibility test so that the system actually evolves
under nontrivial forces during the forward run.

- Particle count: `N = 64`.
- Simulation box: orthorhombic `lx = ly = lz = 8.0`.
- Lattice positions: particle `(ix, iy, iz)` with `i = ix*16 + iy*4 + iz`
  is placed at `(ix * 2.0 - 3.0, iy * 2.0 - 3.0, iz * 2.0 - 3.0)`.
- Position perturbation: each component is offset by
  `0.2 * sin(i * 0.7 + axis_phase)` with axis phases `0.0` (x), `1.1`
  (y), `2.3` (z).
- Initial velocities: all zero.
- Initial forces: zero (overwritten by the warm-up force evaluation).
- Particle masses: all `1.0`.
- Particle IDs: `0..N` (default).
- Lennard-Jones parameters: `sigma = 1.0`, `epsilon = 1.0`,
  `cutoff = 2.5`.
- Timestep: `dt = 0.001`.
- The neighbour list is the packed neighbour list built internally by
  `NeighborListState` during the production pipeline; the fixture does
  not hand-construct it.
- `LosslessBuffers`: freshly allocated, all six residual buffers
  zero-initialised at the start of every run.
- Step count: `N_steps = 100` for the round-trip scenarios.

## Lossless Velocity-Verlet Loop <!-- rq-7b5eef8c -->

A single timestep follows the lossless kick-drift / force / kick
pattern:

```
vv_kick_drift_lossless(particle_buffers, lossless, dt)
jit_composed_pair_force(particle_buffers, output, sim_box, params, ...)
vv_kick_lossless(particle_buffers, lossless, dt)
```

Before the first timestep, `jit_composed_pair_force` are
invoked once to populate `forces_*` with `F(x_0)`. This warm-up is
required because `vv_kick_drift_lossless` consumes the current force
state.

## Reversal Protocol <!-- rq-1d618f18 -->

The standard reversal protocol from `integration.md` applies in full:

1. Capture a snapshot of all eleven `ParticleBuffers` arrays plus all
   six `LosslessBuffers` residual arrays *after* the warm-up but
   *before* the first integrator step. This snapshot is the "initial
   state" the round-trip must restore.
2. Run the lossless velocity-Verlet loop forward for `N_steps`
   iterations. After the loop the device holds positions `x_N`,
   velocities `v_N`, and a forces buffer holding `F(x_N)` from the
   final iteration's `jit_composed_pair_force` pass.
3. Negate every velocity component, both the `f32` high half and the
   `f64` low half: `v ← -v`, `v_lo ← -v_lo`. Forces are not negated;
   they are deterministic functions of positions and remain valid for
   the first reverse step.
4. Run the lossless velocity-Verlet loop forward for `N_steps`
   iterations. No second warm-up is required: the forces buffer
   already holds `F(x_N)`, which is what the next `vv_kick_drift_lossless`
   consumes. Each step recomputes the force via `jit_composed_pair_force` and
   `jit_composed_pair_force` at the new intermediate position, exactly as
   in the forward direction.
5. Negate every velocity component again to restore direction.

The single-step round-trip uses the same protocol with `N_steps = 1`.

The lossy negative test follows the same five-step protocol but
substitutes `vv_kick_drift` and `vv_kick` for the lossless launchers
and operates only on `ParticleBuffers` (no `LosslessBuffers`).

## Comparison Procedure <!-- rq-090b70bb -->

After the round trip completes, the test downloads `ParticleBuffers`
into a host `ParticleState` and downloads each `LosslessBuffers`
field into a host `Vec<f64>`. Comparison against the initial snapshot
splits into three classes:

- **Bit-exact `f32` and `u32` arrays.** `positions_x/y/z`,
  `velocities_x/y/z`, `forces_x/y/z`, `masses`, and `particle_ids` are
  compared with `assert_eq!`. Any drift fails the test.
- **Tolerated `f64` residual arrays.** The six `*_lo` buffers are
  compared element-wise with an absolute tolerance of `1e-10`, matching
  the tolerance used by `rq-b73316ed` in `integration.md`. Residuals
  are internal compensation bookkeeping and are permitted to drift by
  a few `f64` ULPs under round-tripping; the architecture's invariant
  is that this drift never propagates into the observable `f32` state.
- **Lossy negative comparison.** The lossy round-trip's downloaded
  `ParticleState` is compared against the snapshot using `assert_ne!`
  on the union of `positions_x/y/z` and `velocities_x/y/z`. The
  assertion succeeds when *any* element of *any* of those six arrays
  differs from its snapshot value — proving the lossy mode does not
  preserve bit-exact reversibility.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-c2bc2592 -->

- New public types or launchers; this feature is a test only.
- A `simulation_step` or `simulation_step_lossless` orchestration
  function (a future feature in `src/simulation.rs`).
- Energy conservation or other physical-correctness diagnostics.
- Cross-hardware reversibility. The architecture's bit-exactness
  guarantee is GPU-vs-GPU on the same device.
- Reversibility of the residual buffers themselves. The architecture
  permits O(`f64` ULP) per-step residual drift; only the observable
  `f32` state must round-trip bit-exactly.
- Quantitative bounds on how badly the lossy mode fails. The negative
  test only confirms that *some* element differs; it does not measure
  the magnitude of the failure.
- Trajectory I/O.
