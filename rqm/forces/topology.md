# Feature: Topology File, Bond List, Angle List, Exclusion List, and Constraint List <!-- rq-9e1eee68 -->

A simulation's bonded topology is described by a `.topology` file referenced
from the TOML config (`io/config-schema.md`) and consumed by the
`MorseBonded` slot (`morse-bonded.md`), the `HarmonicAngle` slot
(`harmonic-angle.md`), the `Constraint` slot
(`integration/constraint-framework.md`, `integration/shake.md`), and the
Lennard-Jones and Coulomb slots' exclusion logic (`lj-pair-force.md`,
`coulomb-pair-force.md`). The file lists bond instances, angle instances,
per-pair non-bonded exclusions, and rigid constraint groups; bond, angle,
and constraint *types* (parameters) live in the config alongside particle
types.

The file produces four host-side structures: a `BondList` (bonds, with
precomputed per-atom indexing tables for deterministic reduction), an
`AngleList` (angles, with the same indexing pattern), an `ExclusionList`
(per-pair scaling factors for non-bonded interactions between bonded,
angle-coupled, constraint-coupled, or otherwise excluded atoms), and a
`ConstraintList` (rigid constraint groups; see
`integration/constraint-framework.md` for the SoA layout and the kernel
contract).

## File Format <!-- rq-a33c1f4f -->

The `.topology` file is UTF-8 text organised into four named sections,
`[bonds]`, `[exclusions]`, `[angles]`, and `[constraints]`. Each section
may appear at most once; each may be empty; each may be absent (an absent
`[bonds]` means no bonds, an absent `[exclusions]` means no explicit
exclusions, an absent `[angles]` means no angles, an absent
`[constraints]` means no rigid constraint groups). Section headers are
case-sensitive and must appear on their own line. Sections may appear
in any order.

```

```

Inside a section, columns are separated by ASCII whitespace (one or
more space/tab characters). The number of columns per line must match
the section's expected layout; trailing whitespace is tolerated.

### Bond entries <!-- rq-33a054f9 -->

Each non-comment line in `[bonds]` has the form `atom_i atom_j
bond_type_name` where:

- `atom_i: u32` and `atom_j: u32` are zero-based particle indices. Both
  must be `< particle_count`. `atom_i == atom_j` is rejected
  (self-bond).
- `bond_type_name: String` must match the `name` field of an entry in
  the config's `[[bond_types]]` array. Unknown names are rejected.

Bond *order* in the section is preserved for diagnostics. Internally
the parser canonicalises each `(atom_i, atom_j)` pair to
`(min, max)` and sorts the resulting list by `(min, max)` before
assigning bond indices. Two entries that normalise to the same pair
are rejected as duplicates regardless of order in the file.

### Angle entries <!-- rq-73054857 -->

Each non-comment line in `[angles]` has the form `atom_i atom_j atom_k
angle_type_name` where:

- `atom_i: u32`, `atom_j: u32`, and `atom_k: u32` are zero-based
  particle indices. All three must be `< particle_count`. `atom_j` is
  the centre (vertex) atom; `atom_i` and `atom_k` are the wings. The
  geometric angle is the one subtended at `atom_j` by the rays
  `r_i - r_j` and `r_k - r_j`.
- Repeated atoms among `(atom_i, atom_j, atom_k)` are rejected: any of
  `atom_i == atom_j`, `atom_j == atom_k`, or `atom_i == atom_k`
  produces a parser error.
- `angle_type_name: String` must match the `name` field of an entry in
  the config's `[[angle_types]]` array. Unknown names are rejected.

Angle *order* in the section is preserved for diagnostics. Internally
the parser canonicalises each `(atom_i, atom_j, atom_k)` triple by
swapping the two wings so that `atom_i < atom_k` while leaving the
centre `atom_j` in place. The canonicalised triples are then sorted by
`(atom_j, atom_i, atom_k)` before assigning angle indices. Two entries
that normalise to the same triple (same centre and same unordered wing
pair) are rejected as duplicates regardless of order in the file.

### Exclusion entries <!-- rq-4ae7794c -->

Each non-comment line in `[exclusions]` has one of three forms:

- `atom_i atom_j` — both `scale_lj` and `scale_coul` default to `0.0`
  (full exclusion of the pair from both non-bonded potentials).
- `atom_i atom_j scale` — single scale applied identically to LJ and
  Coulomb: `scale_lj = scale_coul = scale`.
- `atom_i atom_j scale_lj scale_coul` — independent per-potential
  scales.

Per-potential scaling lets a `.topology` file express force-field
conventions like AMBER's 1-4 scaling, where LJ-1-4 = 0.5 and
Coulomb-1-4 = 1/1.2 ≈ 0.833.

- `atom_i: u32` and `atom_j: u32` are zero-based particle indices. Both
  must be `< particle_count`. `atom_i == atom_j` is rejected.
- `scale_lj: f32` and `scale_coul: f32` when present are finite numbers
  in `[0.0, 1.0]`. Out-of-range values, NaN, and infinity are rejected.

Like bonds, exclusions are canonicalised to `(min, max)` and sorted by
`(min, max)`. Duplicate pairs (after canonicalisation) are rejected.

### Constraint entries <!-- rq-5f29f928 -->

Each non-comment line in `[constraints]` has the form
`atom_1 atom_2 ... atom_k constraint_type_name` where:

- Every `atom_*: u32` is a zero-based particle index. Every index must
  be `< particle_count`. No atom may repeat within a single row
  (`SelfConstraint`).
- The atom count `k` is determined by the algorithm consumed by the
  named constraint type. For `kind = "shake"`, `k` equals the
  constraint type's declared `atoms` field; for `kind = "settle"`,
  `k` is always 3. Wrong atom count is rejected as
  `InvalidConstraintRow` with a reason that names the expected count.
- `constraint_type_name: String` must match the `name` field of an
  entry in the config's `[[constraint_types]]` array. Unknown names
  are rejected as `UnknownConstraintType`.

Each row defines one *constraint group*. v1 requires that the
constraint graph's connected components match rows one-to-one: no atom
may appear in more than one `[constraints]` row. Two rows that share
any atom are rejected as `DuplicateConstraintAtom`. (Future M-SHAKE
work will lift this restriction; the data layout already accommodates
multi-row groups via the connected-component build described in
`integration/constraint-framework.md`.)

The atom-listing order within a row is preserved verbatim through the
parsed `ConstraintList`. The group's pairwise constraints are derived
from the named constraint type's per-kind specification: for
`kind = "shake"` from the type's `constraints` table (which references
atoms by their position in this row order), and for `kind = "settle"`
from the type's `d_OH`/`d_HH`, synthesised as the canonical water
pattern `{(0, 1, d_OH), (0, 2, d_OH), (1, 2, d_HH)}`. Algorithms that
depend on which atom plays which role (rigid water, where atom 0 is the
oxygen by convention) encode the convention in the row's atom order.

A pair of atoms `(min, max)` that appears as a constraint pair (every
1-2 pair generated by the group's expansion into pairwise constraints
— see `integration/constraint-framework.md`) is forbidden from also
appearing in `[bonds]`. Conflicting rows are rejected as
`BondIsAlsoConstraint`.

### Effective exclusions <!-- rq-24f280af -->

After parsing, the consumer-facing `ExclusionList` is the *effective
exclusion list*, formed by combining the explicit `[exclusions]`
entries with implicit exclusions derived from `[bonds]`, `[angles]`,
and `[constraints]`:

- Every explicit `(i, j, scale_lj, scale_coul)` entry from the file
  becomes an effective exclusion with those two scales.
- For every bond `(i, j)` in `[bonds]` that does **not** have a
  matching explicit `(i, j, _, _)` entry, an implicit exclusion
  `(i, j, 0.0, 0.0)` is added.
- For every angle `(i, j, k)` in `[angles]`, the 1-3 pair `(i, k)` is
  considered. When `(i, k)` does **not** have a matching explicit
  `(i, k, _, _)` entry *and* is not already covered by an implicit
  bond-derived entry, an implicit exclusion `(i, k, 0.0, 0.0)` is
  added.
- For every constraint group in `[constraints]`, every pair `(p, q)`
  of distinct atoms drawn from the group's atom set is considered.
  When `(p, q)` does **not** have a matching explicit `(p, q, _, _)`
  entry *and* is not already covered by an implicit bond-derived or
  angle-derived entry, an implicit exclusion `(p, q, 0.0, 0.0)` is
  added. For a SHAKE-constrained rigid-water group `(O, H1, H2)` this
  produces three implicit exclusions: `(O, H1)`, `(O, H2)`, and
  `(H1, H2)`.

The result is the set of `(i, j, scale_lj, scale_coul)` tuples
consulted by the LJ and Coulomb pair-force kernels. The LJ kernel reads
`scale_lj`; the Coulomb kernel reads `scale_coul`. Explicit entries take
precedence over both implicit bond-derived and implicit angle-derived
entries; an explicit entry with `scale = 1.0` therefore *keeps* the
corresponding non-bonded contribution for a bonded or angle-coupled
pair, which is unusual physics but is the user's deliberate override.

Effective exclusions for pairs that are neither bonded, angle-coupled,
nor explicitly listed are absent from the list; the LJ and Coulomb
kernels treat them as `scale = 1.0` (no scaling).

The framework treats these two implicit-exclusion rules (1-2 from
bonds, 1-3 from angles) as the only default behaviour that affects
simulation results without an explicit user declaration. They are
documented here, in `lj-pair-force.md`, and in `coulomb-pair-force.md`.

### Empty file <!-- rq-1c794f95 -->

A `.topology` file containing zero bonds, zero exclusions, zero
angles, and zero constraints is valid (all sections empty or absent).
The runner produces an empty `BondList`, an empty `AngleList`, an
empty `ExclusionList`, and an empty `ConstraintList`; the
`MorseBonded`, `HarmonicAngle`, and `Constraint` slots are not
constructed.

## Data Model <!-- rq-361623d8 -->

### Bond list <!-- rq-f1210419 -->

For `B` bonds among `N` particles, the host-side `BondList` carries:

- `bonds: Vec<Bond>` — length `B`, sorted by `(atom_i, atom_j)`. Each
  `Bond` records `atom_i: u32`, `atom_j: u32` (with `atom_i < atom_j`),
  and `bond_type_index: u32` (an index into the config's
  `[[bond_types]]` array).
- `atom_bond_offsets: Vec<u32>` — length `N + 1`. For atom `a`, the
  slice
  `atom_bond_indices[atom_bond_offsets[a] .. atom_bond_offsets[a+1]]`
  lists the slot indices in the bond-pair buffer that contribute force
  to atom `a`.
- `atom_bond_indices: Vec<u32>` — length `2 * B` (each bond appears
  twice, once for `atom_i` and once for `atom_j`). Entry `k` is an
  index into the per-bond force buffer of length `2 * B`. The entries
  within a single atom's slice are sorted by the underlying bond
  index, so the reduction's summation order is deterministic across
  runs.

The atom-to-bond indexing is built at load time and uploaded to the
device once. Bonds are immutable for the lifetime of a run; no
recomputation is necessary.

### Angle list <!-- rq-7f8dba1b -->

For `A` angles among `N` particles, the host-side `AngleList` carries:

- `angles: Vec<Angle>` — length `A`, sorted by `(atom_j, atom_i,
  atom_k)`. Each `Angle` records `atom_i: u32`, `atom_j: u32`,
  `atom_k: u32` (the centre is `atom_j`; the wings satisfy
  `atom_i < atom_k`), and `angle_type_index: u32` (an index into the
  config's `[[angle_types]]` array).
- `atom_angle_offsets: Vec<u32>` — length `N + 1`. For atom `a`, the
  slice
  `atom_angle_indices[atom_angle_offsets[a] .. atom_angle_offsets[a+1]]`
  lists the slot indices in the angle-triple buffer that contribute
  force to atom `a`.
- `atom_angle_indices: Vec<u32>` — length `3 * A` (each angle appears
  three times, once for each of its three atoms). Entry `m` is an
  index into the per-angle force buffer of length `3 * A`. Within each
  atom's slice, entries are sorted by the underlying angle index so
  the reduction's summation order is deterministic across runs.

The atom-to-angle indexing is built at load time and uploaded to the
device once. Angles are immutable for the lifetime of a run; no
recomputation is necessary.

### Exclusion list <!-- rq-1e1b4e02 -->

For `E` effective exclusions, the host-side `ExclusionList` carries:

- `entries: Vec<Exclusion>` — length `E`, sorted by `(atom_i, atom_j)`
  with `atom_i < atom_j`. Each `Exclusion` records `atom_i: u32`,
  `atom_j: u32`, `scale_lj: f32`, and `scale_coul: f32`.
- `atom_excl_offsets: Vec<u32>` — length `N + 1`. For atom `a`, the
  slice
  `atom_excl_partners[atom_excl_offsets[a] .. atom_excl_offsets[a+1]]`
  lists the *partners* (`u32`) of `a` in the effective exclusion list,
  paired with their per-potential scale factors.
- `atom_excl_partners: Vec<u32>` — length `2 * E`.
- `atom_excl_lj_scales: Vec<f32>` — length `2 * E`, parallel to
  `atom_excl_partners`. Consumed by the LJ kernel.
- `atom_excl_coul_scales: Vec<f32>` — length `2 * E`, parallel to
  `atom_excl_partners`. Consumed by the Coulomb kernel.

Pair-potential CUDA kernels consult this per-atom lookup table through
the shared device helper `exclusion_scale` declared in
`kernels/exclusions.cuh` (see *Device-side Exclusion Helper* below).
The helper performs the linear scan over atom `i`'s partner range and
returns either the matching scale (from the per-potential scale array
the kernel passes in) or `1.0f` when `j` is not present.

## Device-side Exclusion Helper <!-- rq-b2f23140 -->

`kernels/exclusions.cuh` declares one inline `__device__` helper for
reading the exclusion-list buffers from a pair-potential kernel:

```c
__device__ static inline float exclusion_scale(
    unsigned int i,
    unsigned int j,
    const unsigned int *atom_excl_offsets,
    const unsigned int *atom_excl_partners,
    const float *atom_excl_scales);
```

The helper performs a linear scan over atom `i`'s partner range
`[atom_excl_offsets[i], atom_excl_offsets[i + 1])`. On the first
`atom_excl_partners[m] == j` match it returns `atom_excl_scales[m]`;
when no match is found (including when the range is empty) it returns
`1.0f`. Scan order is from lower index to higher with early exit on
the first match, so the typical-case cost is bounded by atom `i`'s
exclusion-partner count (≤ a few entries for typical bonded systems).

`exclusion_scale` is the canonical device-side reader of the
exclusion-list buffers described in *Exclusion list* above. Each
pair-potential kernel passes the per-potential scale array appropriate
to itself: the LJ kernel passes `atom_excl_lj_scales`, the Coulomb
kernel passes `atom_excl_coul_scales`. Pair-potential `.cu` files
`#include "exclusions.cuh"` and call `exclusion_scale(...)` at the
point they want to scale a pair's contribution by the effective
exclusion factor; nvcc inlines the body into each translation unit.
The header carries no PTX module of its own and `init_device()`
performs no `load_ptx` call for it.

When the exclusion list is empty, every atom's `atom_excl_offsets`
range is empty, the helper returns `1.0f`, and the unscaled
contribution flows through to the caller without a separate code path.

    atom appears more than once in a single `[constraints]` row.
  - `UnknownConstraintType { line_number: usize, name: String }` —
    the row's `constraint_type_name` does not match any

### Functions <!-- rq-e66012e0 -->

- `load_topology_file(path: &Path, particle_count: usize, bond_type_names: &[&str], angle_type_names: &[&str], constraint_types: &[NamedSlotConfig], constraint_registry: &ConstraintRegistry) -> Result<(BondList, AngleList, ExclusionList, ConstraintList), TopologyFileError>` <!-- rq-12b7dcb6 -->
  - Reads the file at `path` and parses all four sections.
  - Validates every constraint described in *File Format*.
  - Returns the canonicalised, sorted `BondList`, `AngleList`, the
    *effective* `ExclusionList` (explicit entries plus implicit
    bond-derived, angle-derived, and constraint-derived defaults),
    and the `ConstraintList` (groups sorted by minimum particle
    index per `integration/constraint-framework.md`).
  - The caller passes `particle_count` (used to bound atom indices),
    `bond_type_names` (used to resolve `bond_type_name` strings to
    indices in the config's `[[bond_types]]` array),
    `angle_type_names` (used to resolve `angle_type_name` strings to
    indices in the config's `[[angle_types]]` array),
    `constraint_types` (the full parsed `[[constraint_types]]`
    array of `NamedSlotConfig` entries, used to resolve
    `constraint_type_name` strings to indices), and
    `constraint_registry` (used to look up each constraint type's
    builder for the `expected_atom_count(&params)` query that
    size-checks `[constraints]` rows).

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-ad0edc95 -->

- Dihedrals, impropers, CMAP terms. The `.topology` file's schema
  reserves no syntax for them.
- Per-bond and per-angle parameter overrides (every bond's parameters
  come from its bond type; every angle's parameters come from its
  angle type).
- Connected-component merging of `[constraints]` rows that share
  atoms. v1 requires disjoint clusters; cross-row groups arrive with
  M-SHAKE. The on-disk format and the in-memory `ConstraintList`
  layout already accommodate the merged case.
- Forming or breaking bonds, angles, or constraints during a
  simulation. All four lists are fixed at start of run.
- A separate `[scaled_exclusions]` section or 1-4-specific syntax.
  Every exclusion is an `(i, j, scale_lj, scale_coul)` tuple; the
  user is responsible for emitting whichever 1-4 exclusions they
  need.
- Multi-`.topology`-file support; the config references at most one
  file.
- Binary topology formats.
- Automatic angle/dihedral derivation from the bond graph. Angle
  declarations are explicit.
- An exclusion "scale = NaN" sentinel to mean "remove implicit
  exclusion". An explicit entry with `scale = 1.0` already achieves
  that effect.
