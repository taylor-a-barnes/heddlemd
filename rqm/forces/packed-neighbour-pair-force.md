# Feature: Packed-Neighbour Pair-Force Architecture <!-- rq-bce26a14 -->

The fast-class pair-force pipeline partitions atoms into 32-atom
**blocks** in cell-sort order and evaluates pair interactions through
a kernel whose neighbour-list element is one **i-block paired with
32 individual j-atoms**. The 32 j-atoms in one entry are not
required to come from the same j-block; they are 32 distinct atoms
that the construction kernel has verified to be within
`r_cut + r_skin` of at least one atom in the i-block. The force
kernel's inner loop runs 32 iterations with a diagonal shuffle so
each of the 32 i-atoms is paired with each of the 32 j-atoms — all
1024 inner iterations evaluate a real pair (the construction has
already filtered candidates).

Forces, potential energies, and virials accumulate via
`atomicAdd` on a per-particle **64-bit fixed-point** buffer.
Integer addition is associative regardless of arrival order, so the
per-particle sum is bit-exact across runs without an ordered
reduction stage. A single conversion kernel translates the
fixed-point sum to `Real` at the end of each step's force
evaluation.

The pipeline has three pair-evaluation passes, each contributing to
the same fixed-point accumulators:

- The **packed-neighbour pass** (the main pair-force kernel) walks
  every entry of `interacting_tiles` / `interacting_atoms` and
  evaluates each pair as scale 1.0. Excluded pairs are treated like
  any other in this pass.
- The **single-pair pass** walks `single_pairs` — individual
  (atom_i, atom_j) pairs extracted at neighbour-list build time
  from sparse (i-block, j-block) candidates. One thread per pair
  evaluates the pair as scale 1.0. Same accumulator, same fixed-
  point semantics.
- The **exclusion-correction pass** walks the topology's canonical
  excluded-pair list (`excluded_pair_atoms` on `ForceField`,
  documented in `jit-composed-pair-force.md`) and adds
  `(exclusion_scale(i, j) − 1.0) × evaluate(i, j)` to each
  excluded pair's contribution. Summing the three passes yields
  `scale × evaluate` per excluded pair and `1.0 × evaluate` per
  non-excluded pair.

This file specifies the data model, the block layout, the
neighbour-list construction pipeline, the force kernel, the
fixed-point force buffers, the JIT composer integration, the
determinism invariants, the configuration surface, and the Feature
API. Adjacent files: `rqm/forces/neighbor-list.md` (the cell-list
spatial pre-step that supplies `sorted_particle_ids`),
`rqm/forces/jit-composed-pair-force.md` (the JIT composer's
per-slot source-fragment contract, with the outer-loop template
specified here), `rqm/forces/framework.md` (the slot framework and
class output buffers — fast-class pair-force slots use the
fixed-point class accumulator described below), `architecture.md`
(the GPU-vs-GPU bit-exact reproducibility invariant, preserved here
by integer associativity).

This architecture applies to fast-class pair-force slots
(`lennard_jones`, `coulomb`, `spme_real`, and any user-registered
fast-class pair-force slot). It does not apply to bonded or angle
slots (which retain their per-bond / per-angle scratch-buffer
architecture), the SPME reciprocal pipeline (unaffected), or any
slow-class slot.

## Scope <!-- rq-1bab5b76 -->

The packed-neighbour architecture is the only force-evaluation
path for fast-class pair-force slots. The JIT-composed pair-force
kernel (`heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_f` /
`heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_fev`) is its entry point and is
launched once per step per `ForceField::step` /
`step_class(Fast, …)` call when at least one fast-class pair-force
slot is active.

`max_neighbors` is not a configuration field. There is no
per-particle padded neighbour list. The neighbour-list buffers are
sized to the actual number of packed entries plus a growth margin
(see *Capacity* below).

## Atom Blocks <!-- rq-0206fbeb -->

Atoms are partitioned into blocks of 32 in the post-cell-sort
ordering supplied by `sorted_particle_ids` (see
`rqm/forces/neighbor-list.md` for the cell-list construction). The
number of blocks is `n_blocks = ⌈N / 32⌉`.

- **Block-index `b` contains 32 sort-positions** `b·32, b·32+1, …,
  b·32+31`. The atom at block position `(b, ℓ)` (block `b`, lane
  `ℓ`) has the original atom ID `sorted_particle_ids[b·32 + ℓ]`.
- For `N` not divisible by 32, the last block has `N mod 32` real
  atoms and `32 − (N mod 32)` inactive lanes. The padding atoms
  are treated as positioned at infinity so they fail every cutoff
  test; the kernel additionally gates per-atom writes through
  `tile_atom_count[b]` (described below).

Block membership is stable across pair-force kernel launches and
changes only at neighbour-list rebuild time.

Per-block metadata held on `NeighborListState`:

- `tile_atom_count: CudaSlice<u32>` of length `n_blocks` — number of
  real atoms in each block. `32` for every block except possibly
  the last.
- `tile_lane_mask: CudaSlice<u32>` of length `n_blocks` — active-lane
  bitmask `(1u << tile_atom_count[b]) − 1`. `0xFFFFFFFF` for full
  blocks; the partial last block (if any) has zeros in the high
  bits.

The mapping from block position to original atom ID is
`sorted_particle_ids[b · 32 + ℓ]`; no separate block-to-particle
table is allocated.

## Tile-Sorted Posq View <!-- rq-512037ca -->

`NeighborListState` carries a per-step-refreshed posq view
indexed by block position:

- `tile_sorted_posq: CudaSlice<Real4>` of length `N` (or `1`
  when `N = 0`).

The semantics are
`tile_sorted_posq[k] = posq[sorted_particle_ids[k]]` for every
`k` in `[0, N)`, so `tile_sorted_posq[k].xyz` is the wrapped
position of the atom at block position `k` and
`tile_sorted_posq[k].w` is that atom's charge. The kernel
`scatter_positions_to_tile_order` writes this buffer once at the
start of every `ForceField::step()` from the current
`ParticleBuffers.posq` array. Inactive lanes in the partial last
block receive `Real4 { x: +∞, y: +∞, z: +∞, w: 0 }` so they
trivially fail every cutoff test in the force kernel and the
construction kernel.

The i-side posq loads in the force kernel and the i-side and
j-side posq loads in the construction kernel read from this view
(one 16-byte coalesced load per atom replaces what would
otherwise be four scalar loads). The j-side posq loads in the
force kernel read `posq[j_atom_id]` directly, where `j_atom_id`
is the original atom ID stored in `interacting_atoms` (see
below); these reads are uncoalesced but benefit from L1 cache
locality when packed j-atoms are spatially clustered, and they
still carry the j-atom's charge through `.w` so the fragment's
`evaluate(…, qi, qj, …)` does not need a separate charges load.

## Block Bounding Boxes <!-- rq-bd3f4707 -->

Per-block axis-aligned bounding boxes are computed at rebuild
time:

- `block_centre: CudaSlice<Real4>` of length `n_blocks` — block
  centre `(x, y, z)` plus the maximum atom-to-centre distance in
  `w`. The `w` term is used to tighten the centre-to-centre
  bounding-sphere prune.
- `block_bbox: CudaSlice<half3>` of length `n_blocks` — bounding-box
  half-extents `(dx, dy, dz)`, stored as half-precision floats so
  the inner pre-filter loop fits more entries in cache. Half-up
  rounding is used so the stored extents never undercount and
  interactions are never missed.

For the partial last block, padding atoms (block positions ≥
`tile_atom_count[b]`) are not allowed to widen the bbox; they
contribute `±∞` sentinel values during the reduction so they are
ignored by the `min`/`max` reduction.

## Sorted-Blocks-by-Volume <!-- rq-4f6fbfcb -->

Blocks are reordered for the pre-filter sweep so the small (dense)
blocks are visited before the large (sparse) ones. The sort key is
`log(dx + dy + dz)` quantised into 20 bins; the sorted array is
held as `sorted_blocks: CudaSlice<u32>` of length `n_blocks`, with
each entry packing `(bin << 22) | block_index` so the radix sort
sees a 32-bit key.

`sorted_blocks` is rebuilt at every neighbour-list rebuild. The
construction-kernel sweep iterates `sorted_blocks` rather than the
identity block ordering.

A second pair of arrays carries bbox data in the sorted order so
the pre-filter avoids one indirection per access:

- `sorted_block_centre: CudaSlice<Real4>` — same shape as
  `block_centre`, permuted by `sorted_blocks`.
- `sorted_block_bbox: CudaSlice<half3>` — same shape as
  `block_bbox`, permuted by `sorted_blocks`.

## Neighbour List <!-- rq-21131a60 -->

The packed neighbour list is a flat array of entries. Each entry
binds one i-block to 32 j-atoms:

- `interacting_tiles: CudaSlice<u32>` of length
  `interacting_tiles_capacity` — `interacting_tiles[pos]` is the
  i-block index for entry `pos`.
- `interacting_atoms: CudaSlice<u32>` of length
  `interacting_tiles_capacity · 32` — `interacting_atoms[pos·32 + ℓ]`
  is one **original atom ID** (not a block position) of a j-atom
  that interacts with the i-block `interacting_tiles[pos]`. The 32
  j-atoms in one entry may come from any combination of j-blocks;
  the only guarantee is that every j-atom has passed the per-atom
  cutoff test against at least one i-atom in
  `interacting_tiles[pos]`. No padding, no mask.

Padding values are reserved: a j-atom slot may carry `N` (i.e., one
past the largest valid atom ID) to indicate "no atom" in the tail
of the final partial entry. The kernel skips slots with value
`>= N`.

When a candidate (i-block, j-block) pair produces no more than
`MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS` surviving j-atom hits, the construction
kernel writes the individual `(i_atom, j_atom)` pairs to a
**single-pair list** instead of merging the j-atoms into the
packed-neighbour buffer:

- `single_pair_atoms: CudaSlice<u32>` of length
  `2 · single_pairs_capacity` — interleaved
  `[i_atom_0, j_atom_0, i_atom_1, j_atom_1, …]` original atom IDs.
  Adjacent pairs `(single_pair_atoms[2k], single_pair_atoms[2k+1])`
  are the two ends of one extracted pair. The construction kernel
  emits one entry per surviving `(i_lane, j_lane)` pair within a
  sparse (i-block, j-block) candidate; a single sparse candidate
  with three j-atom hits, each hitting two i-atoms, produces six
  entries.

`MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS` is a compile-time `#define` in
`kernels/neighbor.cu` set to `3`. Below this threshold the
single-pair pass amortises a full 32×32 = 1024-pair tile loop over
just a handful of true interactions; above it the packed-
neighbour pass is cheaper.

The interaction counts are held on a small device counter array:

- `interaction_count: CudaSlice<u32>` of length 2 —
  `interaction_count[0]` is the live entry count of
  `interacting_tiles` / `interacting_atoms`;
  `interaction_count[1]` is the live entry count of
  `single_pair_atoms` (i.e., one less than twice the slot index
  available for the next pair).

`interaction_count` is reset to `(0, 0)` at the start of every
rebuild.

## Exclusion Handling <!-- rq-03faaf24 -->

The packed-neighbour data model carries no exclusion-tile, bitmask,
or per-pair scale table. Excluded pairs flow through every pair
pass as scale 1.0 and are corrected to the per-fragment scale by
the exclusion-correction kernel documented in
`jit-composed-pair-force.md` (*Correction-Pass Design*).

The construction kernel does not filter excluded pairs out of
`interacting_atoms`; doing so would require per-pair partner-list
memory traffic at build time. Instead, the correction pass adds
`(exclusion_scale(i, j) − 1.0) × evaluate(i, j)` once per
canonical excluded pair, leaving `scale × evaluate` on the
fixed-point accumulators after the main pair-force kernel has
already added `1.0 × evaluate`.

Per-fragment exclusion scales are preserved end-to-end — an
OPLS-style 1-4 exclusion where the Lennard-Jones contribution
scales by `0.5` while the Coulomb contribution scales by `0.833`
flows through the correction kernel naturally because each
fragment's `exclusion_scale(i, j)` functor method returns its own
per-pair value.

## Construction Pipeline <!-- rq-dbffee81 -->

The neighbour-list rebuild runs the following kernels in sequence
on the device's default stream, after the cell-list pre-step has
produced `sorted_particle_ids`:

1. **`scatter_positions_to_tile_order`** — refresh
   `tile_sorted_posq` from `posq` via `sorted_particle_ids`. One
   thread per atom; block size 256. Each thread writes one
   `Real4` value `posq[sorted_particle_ids[k]]` to
   `tile_sorted_posq[k]`, carrying both the position and the
   charge through in a single coalesced store. (This kernel also
   runs every step, not only on rebuild — see *Per-Step Pipeline*
   below.)
2. **`compute_block_bbox`** — one warp per block; each warp's 32
   lanes load 32 atom positions from `tile_sorted_posq` (reading
   only the `.x/.y/.z` components) and reduce min/max via
   `__shfl_xor_sync`. Writes `block_centre`,
   `block_bbox`, and the per-block bounding-sphere radius
   `block_centre[b].w`. Inactive lanes contribute `±∞` so they do
   not widen the box.
3. **`compute_sort_keys`** — one thread per block; reads
   `block_bbox`, computes the volume-bin key `(bin << 22) |
   block_index`, writes `sorted_blocks`. The bin range is computed
   from the global min/max of `block_bbox` sums via a single-block
   reduction.
4. **`sort_blocks_by_volume`** — radix sort by the high bits of
   `sorted_blocks`. Stable; ties broken by block index. Either an
   inline radix sort (preferred) or a CUB-backed sort (acceptable
   if reproducible).
5. **`sort_block_data`** — one thread per block; permutes
   `block_centre` and `block_bbox` through `sorted_blocks` into
   `sorted_block_centre` and `sorted_block_bbox`. Half-precision
   conversion happens here.
6. **`find_blocks_with_interactions`** — the main construction
   kernel. One warp per i-block (iterated through
   `sorted_blocks`). For each candidate j-block (from inner
   sweep), the warp:
   - Computes the centre-to-centre bbox-prune test (`Δ² ≤
     (r_search + radius_i + radius_j)²`) using
     `sorted_block_centre` and `sorted_block_bbox`.
   - For surviving candidates, loads the j-block's 32 atoms and
     tests each j-atom against all 32 i-atoms (via warp-shuffled
     i-positions). Each lane computes a 32-bit
     `i_hit_mask` for its j-atom: bit `m` is set when i-atom `m`
     is within `r_search` of this j-atom (and is not the same
     atom). The lane records `any_hit = (i_hit_mask != 0)`.
   - Computes `hit_ballot = __ballot_sync(any_hit)` and
     `n_hits = __popc(hit_ballot)` — the count of j-atoms in
     this (i-block, j-block) candidate that hit at least one
     i-atom.
   - **Sparse-tile path.** When `n_hits <= MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS`,
     the warp emits one entry per `(i_atom, j_atom)` hit to
     `single_pair_atoms`. Each lane with `any_hit` iterates the
     set bits of its `i_hit_mask`; for each set bit `m`, the
     lane atomically claims a slot via
     `atomicAdd(&interaction_count[1], 1u)` and writes
     `(warp_iid[m], jid)` to
     `single_pair_atoms[2 · slot]` and
     `single_pair_atoms[2 · slot + 1]`. The hits do NOT enter the
     packed-neighbour staging buffer.
   - **Dense-tile path.** When `n_hits > MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS`,
     the j-atoms with `any_hit` are compacted into a per-warp
     staging buffer of size `BUFFER_SIZE` (default 256). When the
     buffer reaches 32, the warp flushes 32 j-atoms into the
     global `interacting_tiles[pos]` /
     `interacting_atoms[pos · 32 + ℓ]` arrays, advancing
     `interaction_count[0]` via `atomicAdd`.
   - At the end of the i-block sweep, the partial tail of the
     dense-path staging buffer is flushed; the final entry pads
     unused slots with `N` (the sentinel "no atom" value) so the
     force kernel's bounds check skips them.

   `MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS` is `3` (compile-time constant in
   `kernels/neighbor.cu`).

   As its final action the kernel writes the live counts to
   `interaction_count[0]` and `interaction_count[1]` on the device and,
   from a single designated thread, sets the `*_high_water` and
   `*_overflow` bits of `neighbor_status` by comparing each count
   against its capacity and high-water mark (see *Capacity*). The
   counts and status are left device-resident; the kernel returns no
   value to the host.

The kernel observes a `force_rebuild` flag from the displacement
check (see *Per-Step Pipeline*) and returns immediately if no
rebuild is needed.

The construction kernel reads the cutoff and skin distance from a
device-side scalar (`r_search_sq`) updated only when the
simulation box generation changes (see
`rqm/forces/neighbor-list.md` for the box-generation
mechanism).

### Capacity <!-- rq-67a09135 -->

`NeighborListState` carries:

- `interacting_tiles_capacity: u32` — current allocated capacity
  of `interacting_tiles` and `interacting_atoms` (the latter is
  sized `interacting_tiles_capacity · 32`).
- `single_pairs_capacity: u32` — current allocated capacity of
  `single_pair_atoms` measured in pairs (the `CudaSlice<u32>` has
  `2 · single_pairs_capacity` slots).
- `tile_pair_growth_factor: f64` — geometric multiplier applied to
  a capacity when it is grown. Greater than 1.0. Default 1.5.
- `tile_pair_fill_threshold: f64` — fraction of a capacity at which
  a build is treated as near-full and the capacity is grown ahead of
  any dropped entry. In the open interval `(0, 1)`. Default 0.8.

Capacities are sized to the *actual* interaction count, never to the
`O(n_blocks²)` all-pairs upper bound. For a cutoff system the live
entry count is `O(N)` — proportional to the number of interacting
atom pairs, not to `n_blocks²`. The initial seed is `O(N)`, a small
multiple of `n_blocks`, clamped down to the all-pairs reference
`n_blocks²` for tiny systems. There is no configuration knob for the
initial capacity; the probe rebuild (below) determines it.

**Device-resident counts.** A steady-state rebuild copies no count
to the host. The construction kernel writes the live counts to the
two-element device buffer `interaction_count` (`[0]` = packed-tile
entries, `[1]` = single pairs). Every downstream consumer launches a
grid sized by a host-known capacity and reads the live count from
`interaction_count` on the device:

- `histogram_entries_by_iblock`, `scatter_entries_by_iblock`, and the
  i-block prefix scan launch over `interacting_tiles_capacity` (and
  `n_blocks`); threads past `interaction_count[0]` exit early.
- The i-block prefix scan's trailing offset sentinel
  `iblock_offset[n_blocks]` is written by a device thread that reads
  `interaction_count[0]`, not from a host value.
- The packed-neighbour force pass launches over `n_blocks`; the
  single-pair force pass launches over `single_pairs_capacity` and
  reads `interaction_count[1]` on the device (see *Single-Pair Pass*).

**Status word.** `CellListData` carries the single-`u32` device
buffer `neighbor_status` (see `neighbor-list.md` *Displacement Check*)
whose bits are:

| Bit | Name | Writer |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `displacement_tripped` | displacement-check kernel, every step |
| 1 | `tiles_high_water` | construction kernel |
| 2 | `single_pairs_high_water` | construction kernel |
| 3 | `tiles_overflow` | construction kernel |
| 4 | `single_pairs_overflow` | construction kernel |

After the construction sweep, a single device thread compares each
live count `interaction_count[c]` against the capacity `capacity_c`
and sets bits via `atomicOr(neighbor_status, …)`:

- `interaction_count[c] > floor(capacity_c · tile_pair_fill_threshold)`
  sets the matching `*_high_water` bit. The build is **complete** — no
  entry was dropped — but the capacity is nearly full.
- A flush that would have exceeded `capacity_c` (an entry would be
  dropped) sets the matching `*_overflow` bit. The construction stops
  writing that buffer past capacity while `interaction_count[c]` keeps
  accumulating the true required count via `atomicAdd`.

**Host response.** The host reads `neighbor_status` exactly once per
batch boundary, folded into the displacement-check read it issues
anyway (see `neighbor-list.md` *Rebuild Policy*); a steady-state
rebuild therefore issues **no** device-to-host transfer of its own.
The host acts on the bits as follows:

- **High-water, no overflow:** grow each flagged capacity geometrically
  to `ceil(capacity_c · tile_pair_growth_factor)`, reallocate the
  buffer, and run a fresh rebuild into the resized buffers so the
  populated list matches the new allocation. `pre_step` reports
  `reallocated = true` and the runner recaptures the phase graph (see
  `cuda-graphs.md` *Neighbor-List Pre-Step Decomposition*). Because
  high-water fires below capacity, the build that raised it dropped
  nothing, so the in-flight list stays correct until the grow-and-
  rebuild completes. Geometric growth is count-free — the host never
  reads the count — and converges in `O(log)` steps for any density.
- **Overflow:** a build dropped within-`r_search` entries, violating
  the no-silent-drop guarantee (`architecture.md`). `pre_step` returns
  `Err(NeighborListError::PackedNeighborOverflow { buffer })`, halting
  the run. With `tile_pair_fill_threshold < 1` and
  `tile_pair_growth_factor > 1`, and atom motion between rebuilds
  bounded by `r_skin / 2`, the per-rebuild count cannot climb from
  below the high-water mark to past capacity between two consecutive
  rebuilds, so this state is unreachable in a well-behaved run and
  exists only as a guard against pathology.

Growth is permitted at *any* rebuild, including one that runs at a
batch boundary inside a CUDA-graph-captured phase. A captured graph's
buffer pointers and launch dimensions must be stable only for the
lifetime of one graph instance, not for the whole phase, so the
buffer-sizing strategy is decoupled from the capture lifetime.

**Probe rebuild.** The first rebuild of a phase runs before CUDA-graph
capture (see `cuda-graphs.md` *Capture Lifecycle*). It reads
`neighbor_status` synchronously and grows-and-retries — growing each
flagged capacity geometrically and re-running the construction from
step 6 (steps 1–5 are not repeated) — until neither a high-water nor
an overflow bit is set, sizing the initial capacities with headroom
below `tile_pair_fill_threshold`. The probe runs once per phase and is
not part of the captured replay loop, so its blocking read does not
appear in the steady-state per-step cost.

## Fixed-Point Force Buffers <!-- rq-a2f419db -->

Forces, potential energies, and per-particle virials are
accumulated in 64-bit fixed-point integer buffers held on
`ForceField`:

- `fast_total_forces_fp_x: CudaSlice<u64>` of length `N`
- `fast_total_forces_fp_y: CudaSlice<u64>`
- `fast_total_forces_fp_z: CudaSlice<u64>`
- `fast_total_potential_energies_fp: CudaSlice<u64>`
- `fast_total_virials_fp: CudaSlice<u64>`

(and analogously `slow_total_*_fp` for slow-class slots that opt
into the same accumulator, e.g. SPME-real; SPME-recip continues
to write to its own `Real` buffer because it is not pair-force
shaped.)

The fixed-point scale is `2^32` (i.e., `0x100000000`):

```text
real_to_fixed(f: Real) -> i64 = (i64) (f * 2^32)
fixed_to_real(s: u64) -> Real = ((i64) s) / 2^32 as Real
```

The conversion uses signed-integer-cast-of-bit-pattern so positive
and negative `Real` values both round to the nearest int64 when
multiplied by `2^32`. The buffers are typed `u64` because CUDA's
`atomicAdd(unsigned long long*, unsigned long long)` is the
available 64-bit atomic; the values are interpreted as i64
two's-complement when reading. Two's-complement integer addition is
associative regardless of operand signedness, so the accumulator is
bit-exact across runs.

At the start of every `ForceField::step` / `step_class(Fast, …)`
call that re-evaluates the fast class, the fast fixed-point
buffers are zeroed via `cudaMemsetAsync`. (`memset` to zero is a
deterministic equivalent of writing all-zero u64 values.) Slow-
class buffers similarly when the slow class re-evaluates.

Per-pair force/energy/virial contributions are accumulated as
follows inside the inner loop of the force kernel:

```text
// per-pair contribution to atom i and atom j:
delta_fx, delta_fy, delta_fz = (factor * dx, factor * dy, factor * dz)
delta_energy = energy_share
delta_virial = virial_share

// per-lane registers accumulate over the 32 inner iterations;
// no atomic in the inner loop:
i_fx += delta_fx;   i_fy += delta_fy;   i_fz += delta_fz;
j_fx -= delta_fx;   j_fy -= delta_fy;   j_fz -= delta_fz;
i_e  += delta_energy * 0.5; j_e += delta_energy * 0.5;
i_w  += delta_virial * 0.5; j_w += delta_virial * 0.5;
```

At the end of the 32-iteration inner loop, each lane atomicAdds
its accumulated `i_*` to the i-atom's fixed-point slot and its
accumulated `j_*` to the j-atom's fixed-point slot. Newton's 3rd
law is satisfied because each pair's contribution is applied once
to each atom (via the same `delta_*` with opposite signs).

After all fast-class pair-force evaluation is complete (one
JIT-composed kernel launch per step), a finalization kernel
`finalize_fast_class_forces` converts the fixed-point buffers to
`Real` and adds them into `ParticleBuffers.forces_*`,
`ParticleBuffers.potential_energies`, and
`ParticleBuffers.virials`. The conversion uses
`fixed_to_real(s)` and the add is performed in `Real`. The
fixed-point buffer is not zeroed by the finalizer (the next step's
class-zero kernel does that).

## Force Kernel <!-- rq-6083409b -->

The fast-class pair-force pipeline has three JIT-composed kernels.
Each pass writes into the same per-particle fixed-point
accumulators (`fast_total_forces_fp_*`,
`fast_total_potential_energies_fp`, `fast_total_virials_fp`); the
finaliser converts to `Real` after all three have run.

### Packed-Neighbour Pass <!-- rq-a4b9e702 -->

For every entry `pos` in `[0, interaction_count[0])`:

- `x = interacting_tiles[pos]`.
- Load 32 i-atoms of `x` (positions from
  `tile_sorted_positions_*[x · 32 + lane]`, original atom IDs from
  `sorted_particle_ids[x · 32 + lane]`).
- Load 32 j-atoms from `interacting_atoms[pos · 32 + lane]`. Each
  is an original atom ID; load its position from
  `positions_*[j_atom_id]`. If `j_atom_id >= N`, the slot is the
  partial-tail padding; treat as inactive.
- Run the 32-iteration diagonal shuffle (described in *Diagonal
  Shuffle* below). For each pair the lane invokes the composer's
  per-pair evaluator (`heddle_jit_eval_pair_sum`, see
  `jit-composed-pair-force.md`), which sums each fragment's
  `evaluate(r², inv_r, r, i, j, …)` with no `exclusion_scale`
  call. Every pair is implicitly scale 1.0 in this pass;
  per-fragment exclusion scales are applied by the correction
  pass.
- AtomicAdd per-lane accumulators to the fixed-point buffer using
  i-atom and j-atom original IDs.

### Single-Pair Pass <!-- rq-b28a6d96 -->

For every entry `k` in `[0, interaction_count[1])`:

- `atom_i = single_pair_atoms[2k]`,
  `atom_j = single_pair_atoms[2k + 1]`.
- One thread per pair. The thread loads both positions, computes
  `(dx, dy, dz, r², inv_r, r)`, invokes the same
  `heddle_jit_eval_pair_sum` evaluator (no `exclusion_scale`
  call; implicit scale 1.0), and atomicAdds the per-fragment
  contribution to both atoms' fixed-point slots. Newton's 3rd is
  observed by adding `+(factor · d)` to atom `i` and
  `−(factor · d)` to atom `j` per component.

### Exclusion-Correction Pass <!-- rq-04fdeac5 -->

The correction pass walks `ForceField.excluded_pair_atoms` and
adds `(exclusion_scale(i, j) − 1.0) × evaluate(i, j)` to each
excluded pair's fixed-point slots. It is documented under
*Correction-Pass Design* in `jit-composed-pair-force.md` and is
not described further here; it shares the fixed-point accumulator
and atom-ID conventions of the two passes above.

### Diagonal Shuffle <!-- rq-18847c46 -->

The packed-neighbour pass's 32-iteration inner loop pattern:

```text
// initial j-side state per lane: lane ℓ holds j-atom ℓ
i_lane = lane
tj = lane
for t in 0..32:
    if (i_atom_id_at(i_lane) != j_atom_id_at(tj)
        && j_atom_id_at(tj) < N) {
        // evaluate pair (i_atom = lane, j_atom_lane = tj):
        compute delta, factor, energy, virial
        i_fx += factor * dx;   i_fy += factor * dy;   i_fz += factor * dz
        j_fx -= factor * dx;   j_fy -= factor * dy;   j_fz -= factor * dz
        i_e  += energy * 0.5;  j_e  += energy * 0.5
        i_w  += virial * 0.5;  j_w  += virial * 0.5
    }
    // shuffle j-side state by one lane:
    j_atom_id, j_x, j_y, j_z, j_fx, j_fy, j_fz, j_e, j_w =
        __shfl_sync(0xFFFFFFFFu, ..., (lane + 1) & 31)
    tj = (tj + 1) & 31
```

The pair-skip predicate `i_atom_id != j_atom_id` covers the
self-pair case when an i-block's atoms happen to appear in the
same entry's j-atom list (e.g., when a sparse-tile boundary
straddles the i-block); the single-pair pass uses the same
predicate at the per-thread level.

After 32 iterations the j-side accumulators have rotated 32 times
and are back at their starting lane. Lane ℓ's `j_*` accumulators
hold the total contribution to the j-atom that started in lane ℓ
(i.e., the j-atom at j-lane `ℓ` of the entry).

The 32-iteration loop count is constant — no early exit. Per-pair
gating is by `j_atom_id < N` (and by the optional
`r2 <= cutoff_squared` check inside each per-slot fragment's
`evaluate`).

### Single-Periodic-Copy Fast Path <!-- rq-5ce17997 -->

The packed-neighbour pass evaluates a per-i-block
single-periodic-copy (SPC) predicate at the top of the outer loop
and branches on the result. The predicate is uniform across the
warp (all 32 lanes processing one i-block compute the same value
from `i_block`, the lattice constants, and the compile-time max
cutoff), so there is no per-pair warp divergence and only one
warp-wide control flow path executes per i-block per launch.

The two code paths are:

- **Min-image path.** For every pair the inner loop calls
  `heddle_jit_triclinic_min_image(dx, dy, dz, lattice…)` to wrap
  `dx = pi - pj` into the canonical `[-L/2, L/2)` displacement
  per lattice direction before the `r²` evaluation.
- **SPC path.** Before entering the inner loop, each lane wraps
  its own `pi` (loaded from `tile_sorted_posq`) and its own `pj`
  (loaded from `posq`) into the periodic image closest to the
  i-block centre `block_centre[i_block]`, using
  `triclinic_wrap_against_center(pos, centre, lattice)`. After
  both wraps, the inner loop computes `dx = pi - pj` and **does
  not call** `heddle_jit_triclinic_min_image` — `dx` is already
  the canonical min-image displacement.

The wrap helper `triclinic_wrap_against_center(pos, centre,
lattice)` shifts `pos` to the periodic image closest to `centre`:

```text
delta = pos - centre
(s_a, s_b, s_c) = triclinic_cart_to_frac(delta, lattice)
(k_a, k_b, k_c) = (-round(s_a), -round(s_b), -round(s_c))
pos += k_a · a + k_b · b + k_c · c
```

where `(a, b, c)` are the lattice vectors. The result satisfies
`|pos − centre|_axis ≤ L_axis / 2` in each lattice direction.

#### Per-Block Eligibility Predicate <!-- rq-4b20b449 -->

The SPC predicate is

```text
spc =     orthorhombic
      AND (0.5 · L_x − block_bbox[i_block].x ≥ MAX_CUTOFF)
      AND (0.5 · L_y − block_bbox[i_block].y ≥ MAX_CUTOFF)
      AND (0.5 · L_z − block_bbox[i_block].z ≥ MAX_CUTOFF)
```

where:

- `orthorhombic` is `(xy == 0 AND xz == 0 AND yz == 0)`, read
  from the lattice constants the kernel already loads at entry.
- `block_bbox[i_block].{x, y, z}` are the i-block's per-axis bbox
  half-extents in Cartesian coordinates, populated by
  `compute_block_bbox` at every rebuild.
- `MAX_CUTOFF` is the aggregated maximum interaction cutoff
  across all active fast-class pair-force slots. The composer
  embeds it as a `#define HEDDLE_JIT_MAX_CUTOFF R(…)` in the
  generated source alongside `HEDDLE_JIT_MAX_CUTOFF_SQUARED`.

Correctness rationale. For an i-block whose bbox half-extent
along axis `d` is `B_d`, every i-atom is within `B_d` of the
centre along that axis. After wrapping `pj` against the centre,
`|pj − centre|_d ≤ L_d / 2`. The candidate j-atom passes the
construction-kernel distance test against some i-atom, so under
min-image relative to that i-atom its position is within
`MAX_CUTOFF + B_d` of the centre. When
`0.5 · L_d − B_d ≥ MAX_CUTOFF`, the centre-image wrap and the
min-image wrap select the same periodic copy, so `pi − pj` is
already the canonical min-image displacement. Out-of-cutoff
candidates (the small fraction that the bbox-prune lets through
even though no real interaction survives) are zeroed by the
existing `cutoff_mask` whether the wrap matched min-image or
not, so the predicate only needs to be safe for in-cutoff pairs.

#### Triclinic Boxes <!-- rq-412fea28 -->

The predicate gates SPC on `orthorhombic`. Triclinic boxes (any
of `xy`, `xz`, `yz` non-zero) take the min-image path on every
i-block regardless of bbox extent. Extending SPC to triclinic
boxes is future work that would replace the per-axis box-length
check with a projection of the i-block bbox onto each face
normal; the kernel helper `triclinic_wrap_against_center` already
handles arbitrary lattice geometry, so the change would be
confined to the eligibility predicate.

#### Box-Geometry Transitions <!-- rq-1ccb6e53 -->

Under NPT or NPH the box and the per-block bbox both change
across a step. The predicate is evaluated freshly at every
i-block of every launch, reading the current lattice constants
(passed as a kernel argument) and the current `block_bbox` (one
of the buffers populated by the per-rebuild
`compute_block_bbox`). No host-side cache or CUDA-graph
re-capture is required when eligibility flips. The kernel
arguments and the `block_centre` / `block_bbox` device pointers
remain valid across a captured graph replay; their contents are
read at every invocation.

#### Single-Pair and Exclusion-Correction Passes <!-- rq-02abafdd -->

The single-pair pass and the exclusion-correction pass continue
to call `heddle_jit_triclinic_min_image` inside their per-pair
evaluation. They do not partition atoms into blocks (each
launches one thread per pair), so there is no per-block centre to
wrap against. The marginal cost of the per-pair min-image call in
these passes is small because each handles at most a few thousand
pairs per step, compared with millions in the packed-neighbour
pass.

### Launch Configuration <!-- rq-8db4fbff -->

Each pass launches as a separate CUDA kernel on the
`particle_buffers.device`'s default stream:

- **Packed-neighbour pass.** Grid
  `⌈n_iblocks / WARPS_PER_BLOCK⌉ × WARPS_PER_BLOCK = n_iblocks`
  blocks of `BLOCK_SIZE = 256` threads (`WARPS_PER_BLOCK = 8`).
  One block per i-block; warps within a block share that
  i-block's i-side accumulators via shared memory. Launched
  unconditionally when at least one fast-class pair-force slot
  is active. The SPC fast-path predicate is evaluated inside the
  kernel at every i-block; the host always passes
  `block_centre` and `block_bbox` and dispatches a single entry
  point per write-EV variant.
- **Single-pair pass.** Grid
  `⌈interaction_count[1] / 256⌉` blocks of `256` threads, one
  thread per single-pair entry. Launched only when
  `interaction_count[1] > 0`.
- **Exclusion-correction pass.** Grid
  `⌈excluded_pair_count / 256⌉` blocks of `256` threads, one
  thread per excluded pair. Launched only when
  `excluded_pair_count > 0`.

The three launches run in this order so the single-pair and
correction passes observe the packed-neighbour pass's writes via
the per-stream ordering of the default stream.

## JIT Composer Integration <!-- rq-ffbee244 -->

The per-slot `PairForceFragment` source contract is documented in
`rqm/forces/jit-composed-pair-force.md`: each fragment provides
`functor_struct`, `functor_source`, `entry_point_args`,
`functor_init_source`, and a `cutoff: CutoffHandling`
declaration. The functor's interface is
`cutoff_squared(i_type, j_type, i, j) -> Real`,
`evaluate(r2, inv_r, r, qi, qj, i_type, j_type, i, j, factor,
energy, virial)`, and `exclusion_scale(i, j) -> Real`. The composer
emits two per-pair evaluators:

- `heddle_jit_eval_pair_sum<WriteEv>(composite, r2, inv_r, r, i,
  j, factor, energy, virial)` — sums each fragment's
  contribution with no `exclusion_scale` call. Used by the
  packed-neighbour pass's diagonal-shuffle inner loop and by the
  single-pair pass's per-thread evaluation.
- `heddle_jit_eval_pair_correction<WriteEv>(composite, r2,
  inv_r, r, i, j, factor, energy, virial)` — sums each
  fragment's contribution scaled by
  `(exclusion_scale(i, j) − 1.0)`. Used by the exclusion-
  correction pass.

Both apply the cutoff handling described in
`jit-composed-pair-force.md` (the per-fragment cutoff guard,
collapsed when `CutoffHandling::Uniform(c)` matches the outer
max-cutoff mask).

### Packed-Neighbour Entry-Point Arguments <!-- rq-e8ba1aff -->

The composer emits two packed-neighbour entry points per
JIT-composed module:

- `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_f`
- `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_fev`

Both share the same argument list, in this order:

```text
const Real4 *posq,
const Real4 *tile_sorted_posq,
const Real *block_centre,
const Real *block_bbox,
const unsigned int *sorted_particle_ids,
const unsigned int *iblock_offset,
const unsigned int *sorted_interacting_atoms,
unsigned int n_iblocks,
const Real *lattice,
unsigned long long *fast_force_x_fp,
unsigned long long *fast_force_y_fp,
unsigned long long *fast_force_z_fp,
unsigned long long *fast_energy_fp,
unsigned long long *fast_virial_fp,
```

`block_centre` is the per-block centre buffer populated by
`compute_block_bbox` (`Real` array of length `4 · n_blocks`,
packed as `(cx, cy, cz, max_disp_sq)`; the SPC wrap reads
`.xyz`). `block_bbox` is the per-block bbox half-extent buffer
populated by the same kernel (`Real` array of length
`3 · n_blocks`, packed as `(dx, dy, dz)`; the SPC predicate reads
all three). Both pointers are always present regardless of
whether any i-block actually takes the SPC path.

Per-fragment arguments are appended after the common arguments in
canonical slot order. The trailing `unsigned int n` is the final
argument.

The `_fev` entry point uses the same argument list as `_f`; the
`_f` entry point's emitted inner loop simply does not increment
`fast_energy_fp` / `fast_virial_fp`.

### Single-Pair Entry-Point Arguments <!-- rq-f119bc11 -->

The single-pair pass has its own pair of entry points:

```text
extern "C" __global__ void heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_single_f(...)
extern "C" __global__ void heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_single_fev(...)
```

Common arguments, in order:

```text
const Real4 *posq,
const unsigned int *single_pair_atoms,
unsigned int single_pair_count,
const Real *lattice,
unsigned long long *fast_force_x_fp,
unsigned long long *fast_force_y_fp,
unsigned long long *fast_force_z_fp,
unsigned long long *fast_energy_fp,
unsigned long long *fast_virial_fp,
```

Per-fragment arguments are appended in canonical slot order
followed by the trailing `unsigned int n`. The per-fragment list
is identical to the packed-neighbour entry point's per-fragment
list (the same `bind_pair_force_args` invocations populate it).

## Per-Step Pipeline <!-- rq-0acba2a0 -->

The fast-class pair-force pipeline runs the following sequence
every step:

| # | Stage | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `scatter_positions_to_tile_order` | Every step |
| 2 | Pre-step neighbour-list check | Every step; rebuild may run if displacement exceeds `r_skin / 2` |
| 3 | `cudaMemsetAsync` zeroing fast fixed-point buffers | Every step (or only when re-evaluating the Fast class) |
| 4 | `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_{f,fev}` (packed-neighbour pass) | Once per step; per-i-block SPC predicate inside the kernel selects between the min-image branch and the centre-wrap branch |
| 5 | `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_single_{f,fev}` (single-pair pass) | Once per step (only if `interaction_count[1] > 0`) |
| 6 | `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_correct_{f,fev}` (exclusion-correction pass) | Once per step (only if `excluded_pair_count > 0`) |
| 7 | `finalize_fast_class_forces` | Once per step; converts fixed-point to Real and adds into `ParticleBuffers.forces_*` |

When step 2 triggers a rebuild, the rebuild pipeline (steps 1–6 of
*Construction Pipeline*, including the second `scatter` since
`sorted_particle_ids` has changed) runs before step 3.

## Configuration <!-- rq-9527bd2d -->

The `[neighbor_list]` section of the simulation config carries:

- `mode: "cell-list" | "all-pairs"` — unchanged from the existing
  `NeighborListConfig`.
- `r_skin: f64` (length, in active unit system) — unchanged from
  the existing `NeighborListConfig`.
- `tile_pair_growth_factor: f64` — geometric multiplier applied to
  the `interacting_tiles` and `single_pair_atoms` capacities when one
  is grown. Must be greater than 1.0. Default 1.5.
- `tile_pair_fill_threshold: f64` — fraction of a capacity at which a
  build is treated as near-full and the capacity is grown ahead of any
  dropped entry (see *Capacity*). Must lie in the open interval
  `(0, 1)`. Default 0.8.

The `interacting_tiles` and `single_pair_atoms` capacities themselves
are not configurable. They are sized automatically from the first
rebuild's true interaction count (see *Capacity*) and grown on demand,
so there is no initial-capacity field to tune.

The field `max_neighbors` is **not** part of `NeighborListConfig`.
Specifying it in the configuration file is a load-time error with
an explanatory message that the field is no longer used.

## Determinism <!-- rq-db98d977 -->

Two independent runs starting from byte-identical inputs produce
byte-identical outputs (forces, energies, virials). The invariants
supporting this:

1. **Deterministic cell-list pre-step.** `sorted_particle_ids` is
   a pure function of the input particle state (see
   `rqm/forces/neighbor-list.md`).
2. **Deterministic block layout and bbox.** Block membership and
   block bounding boxes are pure functions of
   `sorted_particle_ids` and the current positions.
3. **Deterministic volume sort.** The block-volume sort uses a
   stable radix sort keyed on `(volume_bin << 22) | block_index`,
   so equal-volume blocks tie-break on block index — deterministic.
4. **Deterministic construction sweep.** The construction kernel
   sweeps `sorted_blocks` in fixed index order. The per-warp
   staging buffer flushes in fixed order (the warp's lanes contribute
   in lane order via `__ballot_sync` + prefix-sum packing). The
   global `atomicAdd(&interaction_count[0], …)` assigns a
   deterministic *count*, but the per-entry write order is
   determined by warp-scheduling. **This is acceptable because the
   force kernel processes entries via the fixed-point atomic
   accumulator, whose final per-particle sum is invariant under
   permutation of entries.**
5. **Deterministic excluded-pair enumeration.** The exclusion-
   correction pass's pair list (`ForceField.excluded_pair_atoms`)
   is enumerated at `ForceField::new` time in the canonical order
   of `ExclusionList.entries` and is constant across the
   simulation. Each excluded pair contributes its correction
   exactly once regardless of which warp first claimed the slot
   in the packed-neighbour pass.
6. **Bit-exact accumulation via integer atomics.** Per-particle
   force, energy, and virial accumulators are 64-bit unsigned
   integers interpreted as two's-complement signed integers.
   Integer addition is associative under two's-complement
   arithmetic regardless of operand order. `atomicAdd` on
   `unsigned long long` is the load-bearing primitive; its
   per-atom result is independent of how many warps wrote to that
   atom and in what order.
7. **Deterministic conversion.** The fixed-point-to-real
   conversion `(int64) sum / 2^32` is a deterministic function of
   the integer sum; the final `Real` addition into
   `ParticleBuffers.forces_*` happens in a kernel that reads each
   atom's slot exactly once.

The reproducibility scope is GPU-vs-GPU on the same hardware,
matching `architecture.md`. CPU-vs-GPU is not promised.

## Feature API <!-- rq-e1643cc5 -->

### Types <!-- rq-86f757e0 -->

- `NeighborListState` adds the fields documented under *Atom <!-- rq-b5c18e6b -->
  Blocks*, *Tile-Sorted Position View*, *Block Bounding Boxes*,
  *Sorted-Blocks-by-Volume*, and *Neighbour List* above. The
  per-particle padded `neighbor_list` and `neighbor_counts` fields
  are not present.
- `ForceField` adds the fixed-point class accumulator fields <!-- rq-e6b37d18 -->
  documented under *Fixed-Point Force Buffers*. The per-class
  `fast_total_forces_x/y/z` (and the `_potential_energies` /
  `_virials`) become `unsigned long long` fixed-point arrays; the
  per-slot `SlotOutputView` framework no longer issues 5-array
  bind targets for fast-class pair-force slots (it remains for
  bonded and angle slots, and for slow-class slots not using
  packed-neighbour).
- `NeighborListConfig` carries the fields documented under <!-- rq-3fbb8dea -->
  *Configuration*, including `tile_pair_growth_factor` (default 1.5,
  `> 1.0`) and `tile_pair_fill_threshold` (default 0.8, in `(0, 1)`).
  The `max_neighbors` field is absent; the TOML parser reports an
  explicit error if `max_neighbors` appears in the config text.
- `NeighborListError` carries the variant <!-- rq-2dda3169 -->
  `PackedNeighborOverflow { buffer: &'static str }` — returned by
  `NeighborListState::pre_step` when a steady-state build set a
  `*_overflow` bit of `neighbor_status`, meaning a packed-neighbour
  buffer would have dropped within-`r_search` entries. `buffer` names
  the buffer that overflowed (`"interacting_tiles"` or
  `"single_pair_atoms"`). This is the only neighbour-overflow error;
  there is no per-particle neighbour cap to exceed.

### CUDA Kernels <!-- rq-2647cb7e -->

- `scatter_positions_to_tile_order(posq, sorted_particle_ids, <!-- rq-89245537 -->
  tile_sorted_posq, n)` — one thread per atom; block 256. Reads
  one `Real4` from `posq[sorted_particle_ids[k]]` per thread and
  writes it to `tile_sorted_posq[k]`.
- `compute_block_bbox(tile_sorted_posq, tile_atom_count, <!-- rq-9f947525 -->
  block_centre, block_bbox, n_blocks)` — one warp per block.
  Reads `.x/.y/.z` from `tile_sorted_posq` and ignores `.w`.
- `compute_sort_keys(block_bbox, sorted_blocks, n_blocks)` — one <!-- rq-e9ed7617 -->
  thread per block; preceded by a single-block reduction for the
  global bbox-sum range.
- `sort_blocks_by_volume(sorted_blocks, n_blocks)` — radix sort. <!-- rq-62f00166 -->
- `sort_block_data(sorted_blocks, block_centre, block_bbox, <!-- rq-c1afd2f3 -->
  sorted_block_centre, sorted_block_bbox, n_blocks)` — one
  thread per block.
- `find_blocks_with_interactions(sorted_blocks, <!-- rq-169e1d84 -->
  sorted_block_centre, sorted_block_bbox, tile_sorted_positions_*,
  interacting_tiles, interacting_atoms, single_pair_atoms,
  interaction_count, interacting_tiles_capacity,
  single_pairs_capacity, tiles_high_water_mark,
  single_pairs_high_water_mark, r_search_sq, lattice,
  force_rebuild_flag, n_blocks, n_atoms, neighbor_status)` — main
  construction kernel. One warp per i-block iterating through
  `sorted_blocks`. Writes the live counts to `interaction_count` and,
  from a single designated thread, sets the `*_high_water` and
  `*_overflow` bits of `neighbor_status` (see *Capacity*); it returns
  no count or status to the host. The `*_high_water_mark` arguments are
  `floor(capacity · tile_pair_fill_threshold)`, computed on the host
  from the current capacities. The `MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS = 3` threshold
  is a compile-time `#define`.
- `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_f` / <!-- rq-42e29605 -->
  `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_fev` — JIT-composed packed-
  neighbour entry points; argument list documented under
  *Packed-Neighbour Entry-Point Arguments*. Each evaluates the
  per-i-block SPC predicate at runtime and branches between the
  centre-wrap fast path and the per-pair min-image path; the
  branch is uniform across the warp.
- `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_single_f` / <!-- rq-3ddf259b -->
  `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_single_fev` — JIT-composed
  single-pair entry points; argument list documented under
  *Single-Pair Entry-Point Arguments*.
- `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_correct_f` / <!-- rq-41ba5dca -->
  `heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_correct_fev` — JIT-composed
  exclusion-correction entry points; argument list documented
  under *Correction-Pass Design* in
  `jit-composed-pair-force.md`.
- `finalize_fast_class_forces(fast_force_*_fp, fast_energy_fp, <!-- rq-9c80a966 -->
  fast_virial_fp, particle_forces_x, particle_forces_y,
  particle_forces_z, particle_potential_energies,
  particle_virials, n)` — one thread per atom; converts
  fixed-point sums to Real and `+=` into the particle buffers.
- `finalize_slow_class_forces` (analogous, when slow class uses <!-- rq-2c323eaa -->
  the fixed-point accumulator).

### Functions <!-- rq-c85fa8d1 -->

- `crate::gpu::scatter_positions_to_tile_order(kernels, buffers, <!-- rq-595e7ea4 -->
  sorted_particle_ids, tile_sorted_posq) -> Result<(), GpuError>`
  — launches the scatter kernel. Reads from `buffers.posq`.
- `crate::gpu::compute_block_bbox(kernels, tile_sorted_posq, <!-- rq-3a31b3f0 -->
  tile_atom_count, block_centre, block_bbox, n_blocks) ->
  Result<(), GpuError>`.
- `crate::gpu::sort_blocks_by_volume(kernels, block_bbox, <!-- rq-ad6f0de0 -->
  sorted_blocks, sorted_block_centre, sorted_block_bbox,
  n_blocks) -> Result<(), GpuError>` — runs the three sub-steps
  (compute keys, radix sort, sort_block_data) as a single
  callable.
- `crate::gpu::find_blocks_with_interactions(kernels, …) -> <!-- rq-68a9602b -->
  Result<(), GpuError>` — launches the construction kernel. The live
  counts stay in `interaction_count` and the near-full / overflow
  state stays in `neighbor_status`, both on the device; the wrapper
  copies nothing to the host. The host learns of high-water or overflow
  only through the once-per-batch `neighbor_status` read (see
  `neighbor-list.md` *Rebuild Policy*).
- `crate::gpu::finalize_fast_class_forces(kernels, fp_buffers, <!-- rq-5a7f78c4 -->
  particle_buffers, n) -> Result<(), GpuError>`.
- `NeighborListState::rebuild` runs the cell-list pre-step followed by <!-- rq-4896a257 -->
  the construction pipeline above. It zeros
  `neighbor_status` before the cell-list and construction kernels run,
  copies no interaction count to the host, and reports buffer growth
  through `PreStepOutcome.reallocated`. A steady-state (non-probe)
  rebuild issues no device-to-host transfer.

### Helper Functions in the JIT-Composed Source <!-- rq-49f2304c -->

The composer emits the following helpers into the kernel preamble
(in addition to the existing `heddle_jit_triclinic_min_image`
and the per-slot helpers):

- `__device__ static inline long long heddle_jit_real_to_fixed(Real f) <!-- rq-8de805b0 -->
   { return (long long) (f * (Real) (1ull << 32)); }`
- `__device__ static inline Real heddle_jit_fixed_to_real(unsigned long long s) <!-- rq-d244267b -->
   { return ((Real) (long long) s) / (Real) (1ull << 32); }`
- A 32-iteration diagonal-shuffle macro `HEDDLE_JIT_SHUFFLE_PAIR_LOOP`
  that emits the inner loop including the per-lane `i_*` / `j_*`
  accumulators and the trailing `__shfl_sync` rotation.
- `__device__ static inline void <!-- rq-25515b9a -->
  triclinic_wrap_against_center(Real &x, Real &y, Real &z,
  Real cx, Real cy, Real cz, Real lx, Real ly, Real lz,
  Real xy, Real xz, Real yz)` — shifts `(x, y, z)` to the
  periodic image of itself that is closest to `(cx, cy, cz)`.
  Computes the fractional displacement `(δx, δy, δz) =
  (x - cx, y - cy, z - cz)` via `triclinic_cart_to_frac`, rounds
  each component to the nearest integer to obtain
  `(k_a, k_b, k_c)`, and subtracts `k_a · a + k_b · b + k_c · c`
  from `(x, y, z)`. After the call,
  `|x − cx|_axis ≤ L_axis / 2`. Lives in `kernels/pbc.cuh`
  alongside `triclinic_min_image` and is reused by both SPC
  entry-point variants.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-ee43a3fe -->

- **`f64` compile-time builds.** The fixed-point representation
  assumes `Real == f32` so the scale `2^32` fits in `long long`
  with adequate range for typical MD force magnitudes. The `f64`
  build path returns an explicit error at `ForceField::new` if
  this architecture is in use; an `f64` extension would require a
  wider fixed-point type (e.g., split-int128 atomics or a
  software-emulated 128-bit accumulator) and is deferred.
- **The `USE_LARGE_BLOCKS` optimisation.** Optionally pre-filters
  with the bbox of 32 consecutive blocks ("large blocks") before
  the per-block sweep. The optimisation is omitted from this
  architecture; if the per-block sweep becomes a measurable
  bottleneck for very large `N` it can be added without changing
  the data model.
- **Position reordering of `posq` into block order.** Consider
  permuting `posq` into block order so the force kernel's
  `posq[j]` reads are sequential within the warp. This
  architecture keeps `positions_*` in original atom-ID order and
  pays a per-pair indirect load for j-positions. The optimisation
  is deferred; it requires moving every per-atom parameter table
  (charges, type indices, exclusion offsets, etc.) into block
  order at every rebuild.
- **Mixed-precision energy/virial accumulation.** Energy and
  virial use the same `2^32` fixed-point scale as forces. The
  shared scale is adequate for typical MD energy ranges but may
  saturate for unusually large systems; a separate finer scale
  for energies is deferred.

## Gherkin Scenarios <!-- rq-9333127d -->

```gherkin
Feature: Packed-Neighbour Pair-Force Architecture

  Background:
    Given a fast-class pair-force pipeline with at least one
      Lennard-Jones, Coulomb, or SPME-real slot active
    And N particles laid out in cell-list order

  # --- Block layout ---

  @rq-c5e23ba8
  Scenario: Block count derives from ceil(N / 32)
    Given N = 100
    When NeighborListState::rebuild completes
    Then n_blocks equals 4
    And tile_atom_count holds [32, 32, 32, 4]
    And tile_lane_mask holds [0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF, 0x0000000F]

  @rq-48a014ed
  Scenario: Full block carries lane mask 0xFFFFFFFF
    Given a block b with tile_atom_count[b] = 32
    When NeighborListState::rebuild completes
    Then tile_lane_mask[b] equals 0xFFFFFFFF

  @rq-5631e383
  Scenario: Partial last block carries truncated lane mask
    Given N = 100 so block 3 has 4 real atoms
    When NeighborListState::rebuild completes
    Then tile_lane_mask[3] equals 0x0000000F
    And the high 28 bits of tile_lane_mask[3] are zero

  # --- Tile-sorted position view ---

  @rq-d9197bb9
  Scenario: tile_sorted_positions reflects current positions after the scatter
    Given a simulation step that has just completed integration
    When scatter_positions_to_tile_order runs at the start of
      ForceField::step
    Then tile_sorted_positions_x[k] equals
      positions_x[sorted_particle_ids[k]]
      for every k in [0, N)
    And the same equality holds for y and z

  @rq-146221cb
  Scenario: Scatter runs every step regardless of rebuild
    Given a simulation that runs 10 steps with the displacement-driven
      rebuild firing every 5 steps
    When the simulation completes
    Then KernelStage::SCATTER_POSITIONS_TO_TILE_ORDER records exactly
      10 launches

  @rq-ede1fc4c
  Scenario: Partial-block inactive lanes carry +infinity
    Given N = 100 so block 3 has 4 real atoms
    When scatter_positions_to_tile_order completes
    Then tile_sorted_positions_x[100..128] hold positive infinity
    And tile_sorted_positions_y[100..128] hold positive infinity
    And tile_sorted_positions_z[100..128] hold positive infinity

  # --- Block bounding boxes ---

  @rq-2f77077b
  Scenario: Full block bbox spans all 32 atoms
    Given block b is full
    When compute_block_bbox runs
    Then block_centre[b].x equals the mean of the 32 atoms' x positions
    And block_bbox[b].dx covers the maximum atom-from-centre displacement in x

  @rq-6ca8a9c4
  Scenario: Partial block bbox ignores inactive lanes
    Given block 3 has 4 real atoms at positions p0..p3
    When compute_block_bbox runs
    Then block_centre[3] reflects only p0..p3
    And no inactive lane widens block_bbox[3]

  # --- Volume sort ---

  @rq-7fcd6e99
  Scenario: sorted_blocks is sorted by volume bin ascending
    When sort_blocks_by_volume completes
    Then for every consecutive pair sorted_blocks[i], sorted_blocks[i+1],
      the high 10 bits of sorted_blocks[i] are <= the high 10 bits of
      sorted_blocks[i+1]

  @rq-e6de7839
  Scenario: Equal-volume blocks tie-break on block index
    Given two blocks b1 < b2 with identical volume bins
    When sort_blocks_by_volume completes
    Then b1 appears before b2 in sorted_blocks

  # --- Neighbour-list construction ---

  @rq-1470ef9f
  Scenario: interacting_atoms entries contain only real neighbours
    Given the construction kernel has completed
    When for every entry pos in [0, interaction_count[0])
      and every lane L in [0, 32)
    Then either interacting_atoms[pos*32 + L] >= N (the no-atom sentinel)
    Or interacting_atoms[pos*32 + L] is an atom whose position is within
      r_cut + r_skin of at least one atom in
      sorted_particle_ids[interacting_tiles[pos] * 32 .. (interacting_tiles[pos]+1) * 32]
      under minimum image

  @rq-e8667000
  Scenario: Sparse (i-block, j-block) candidate routes its pairs to single_pair_atoms
    Given a candidate (i-block, j-block) pair that produces n_hits j-atoms with any_hit
    And n_hits <= MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS (= 3)
    When the construction kernel processes this candidate
    Then for every j-atom with any_hit and every i-atom in its i_hit_mask, one (atom_i, atom_j) entry is written to single_pair_atoms (advancing interaction_count[1] by one per (i, j) hit)
    And no entry is written to interacting_atoms for this candidate

  @rq-560d3be9
  Scenario: Dense (i-block, j-block) candidate routes its hits to interacting_atoms
    Given a candidate (i-block, j-block) pair that produces n_hits j-atoms with any_hit
    And n_hits > MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS (= 3)
    When the construction kernel processes this candidate
    Then the surviving j-atoms enter the per-warp staging buffer and contribute to interacting_tiles / interacting_atoms when the buffer reaches 32
    And no entry is written to single_pair_atoms for this candidate

  @rq-b1060817
  Scenario: MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS equals 3
    Given the construction kernel's compiled source
    Then `MAX_BITS_FOR_PAIRS` resolves to the literal 3

  @rq-7646dd13
  Scenario: Probe rebuild grows interacting_tiles on a near-full build
    Given the phase has not yet been CUDA-graph captured
    And interacting_tiles_capacity = 100 with tile_pair_fill_threshold = 0.8
    And a system that produces 90 packed entries
    When the probe rebuild runs find_blocks_with_interactions
    Then the tiles_high_water bit of neighbor_status is set
    And no entry was dropped from the 90-entry build
    And the probe reallocates interacting_tiles to ceil(100 * 1.5)
    And the construction is re-run from find_blocks_with_interactions

  @rq-e7839cee
  Scenario: Probe rebuild grows single_pair_atoms on a near-full build
    Given the phase has not yet been CUDA-graph captured
    And single_pairs_capacity = 50 with tile_pair_fill_threshold = 0.8
    And a system that produces 45 single-pair entries
    When the probe rebuild runs find_blocks_with_interactions
    Then the single_pairs_high_water bit of neighbor_status is set
    And the probe reallocates single_pair_atoms to ceil(50 * 1.5) pairs
    And the construction is re-run from find_blocks_with_interactions

  @rq-8253d3c4
  Scenario: interaction_count and neighbor_status are reset at the start of every rebuild
    Given a prior rebuild left interaction_count = [50, 12]
      and neighbor_status with the tiles_high_water bit set
    When NeighborListState::rebuild begins a new rebuild
    Then interaction_count is reset to [0, 0]
      and neighbor_status is reset to 0 before
      find_blocks_with_interactions launches

  @rq-b8504fa1
  Scenario: A steady-state rebuild copies no count or status to the host
    Given a CUDA-graph-captured phase past its pre-capture probe rebuild
    And a batch boundary on which the displacement bit triggers a rebuild
    When NeighborListState::rebuild runs the construction pipeline
    Then no dtoh_sync_copy of interaction_count is issued
    And no dtoh_sync_copy reads find_blocks_with_interactions output other
      than the single combined neighbor_status word read by the batch loop

  @rq-e1258ceb
  Scenario: Downstream kernels launch over capacity and read the live count from the device
    Given a build that produced interaction_count[0] = C tile entries
      into a buffer of capacity interacting_tiles_capacity = K with C < K
    When histogram_entries_by_iblock, the i-block prefix scan, and
      scatter_entries_by_iblock run
    Then each is launched with a grid sized by K (and n_blocks), not by C
    And threads whose entry index is >= interaction_count[0] exit early
    And iblock_offset[n_blocks] equals interaction_count[0] without any host
      value being supplied

  @rq-88175d6f
  Scenario: High-water at a batch boundary grows geometrically and recaptures
    Given a CUDA-graph-captured phase under a densifying barostat
    And a batch-boundary build that sets the tiles_high_water bit without
      setting any overflow bit
    When the batch loop reads neighbor_status
    Then interacting_tiles_capacity grows to ceil(capacity * tile_pair_growth_factor)
    And a fresh rebuild populates the resized buffers
    And pre_step reports reallocated = true
    And the runner recaptures the phase graph

  @rq-a5bd8157
  Scenario: An overflow bit halts the run rather than dropping interactions
    Given a batch-boundary build whose true count exceeds capacity so that an
      entry would be dropped
    When the batch loop reads neighbor_status and observes a tiles_overflow bit
    Then pre_step returns Err(NeighborListError::PackedNeighborOverflow { buffer: "interacting_tiles" })
    And the run halts without presenting forces from the incomplete list as final

  # --- Force kernel ---

  @rq-a786df3a
  Scenario: Packed-neighbour pass runs one block per i-block
    Given n_iblocks i-blocks with any fast-class pair-force slot active
    When the JIT-composed pair-force kernel launches
    Then the grid has n_iblocks blocks of BLOCK_SIZE = 256 threads each

  @rq-a6ecc598
  Scenario: Packed-neighbour pass skips the no-atom sentinel
    Given an entry pos with interacting_atoms[pos*32 + lane] == N for some lane
    When the packed-neighbour kernel processes entry pos
    Then no pair contribution is accumulated for that lane

  @rq-b49bfdff
  Scenario: Packed-neighbour pass treats every pair as scale 1.0
    Given a ForceField with at least one fast-class pair-force fragment
    And the JIT-composed packed-neighbour kernel source captured for inspection
    Then the packed-neighbour pass's inner loop dispatches to heddle_jit_eval_pair_sum (no exclusion_scale calls)
    And the source contains zero calls to composite.<any>.exclusion_scale inside the packed-neighbour outer loop

  @rq-80c6a964
  Scenario: Fully-excluded pair nets to zero on the fixed-point accumulator
    Given a pair (i, j) where every active fragment's exclusion_scale(i, j) returns 0.0
    And the pair is within HEDDLE_JIT_MAX_CUTOFF_SQUARED
    When the packed-neighbour and exclusion-correction passes both run
    Then the packed-neighbour pass adds +1.0 × evaluate(i, j) to atom i and -1.0 × evaluate(i, j) to atom j (Newton's 3rd)
    And the exclusion-correction pass adds (0.0 - 1.0) × evaluate(i, j) = -evaluate(i, j) to atom i and +evaluate(i, j) to atom j
    And the per-atom fixed-point slots sum to zero after both passes

  @rq-8840662f
  Scenario: Per-fragment exclusion scale yields per-fragment net contribution
    Given a pair (i, j) where the LJ fragment's exclusion_scale(i, j) returns 0.5
    And the Coulomb fragment's exclusion_scale(i, j) returns 0.833
    When the packed-neighbour and exclusion-correction passes both run
    Then the LJ contribution to atoms i and j is exactly 0.5 × the unexcluded LJ pair value
    And the Coulomb contribution to atoms i and j is exactly 0.833 × the unexcluded Coulomb pair value

  # --- Single-pair pass ---

  @rq-86cc8e5d
  Scenario: Single-pair pass is skipped when its count is zero
    Given interaction_count[1] == 0
    When the force-evaluation pipeline runs
    Then heddle_jit_composed_pair_force_single_f is not launched

  @rq-8d86bfa6
  Scenario: Single-pair pass accumulates Newton's-3rd pair forces
    Given single_pair_atoms[2k] = i and single_pair_atoms[2k+1] = j with the pair inside cutoff
    When the single-pair kernel processes pair index k
    Then the contribution to atom i is `+factor·(dx, dy, dz)` in fixed point
    And the contribution to atom j is `-factor·(dx, dy, dz)` in fixed point
    And both contributions are atomicAdded to the same fixed-point accumulator the packed-neighbour pass writes

  # --- Fixed-point accumulation ---

  @rq-5b560577
  Scenario: Fixed-point buffers are zeroed at the start of every force evaluation
    Given a prior step left fast_total_forces_fp_x with arbitrary values
    When ForceField::step(Fast) begins re-evaluation
    Then fast_total_forces_fp_x is cuda-memset to zero before the
      composed pair-force kernel launches

  @rq-578a4020
  Scenario: Conversion preserves f32 precision in the typical range
    Given a fixed-point sum produced by accumulating 1000 random f32
      values in range [-100, 100]
    When fixed_to_real is applied
    Then the result equals the corresponding f32 Kahan sum to within
      f32 round-off

  @rq-b2894e9e
  Scenario: Saturation triggers an error if force exceeds the fixed-point range
    Given a Real value f such that f * 2^32 exceeds i64::MAX
    When real_to_fixed is invoked
    Then the conversion saturates and the finalization kernel sets an
      overflow flag

  @rq-40b8dfb2
  Scenario: Newton's 3rd is observed
    Given a pair (i, j) evaluated in the force kernel
    When the kernel completes
    Then the contribution to atom i is exactly the negation of the
      contribution to atom j (per coordinate)

  # --- Reproducibility ---

  @rq-f9e0aa11
  Scenario: Two GPU runs produce byte-identical packed neighbour lists
    Given two simulations started from byte-identical initial state
    When both run a single neighbour-list rebuild
    Then interaction_count is byte-identical across the two runs
    And the sorted contents of (interacting_tiles, interacting_atoms)
      are byte-identical across the two runs
    And the sorted contents of single_pairs are byte-identical across
      the two runs

  @rq-5aee0b50
  Scenario: Two GPU runs produce byte-identical per-particle forces
    Given two simulations started from byte-identical initial state
    When both run ForceField::step(Fast) once
    Then ParticleBuffers.forces_x, forces_y, forces_z compare
      byte-identical across the two runs after finalize_fast_class_forces

  @rq-0fbfc03f
  Scenario: Force result is invariant under construction-write-order
    Given a system where two runs produce the same set of packed entries
      but in different per-position write order
    When ForceField::step(Fast) runs in each
    Then the per-particle force sums are byte-identical (because integer
      atomicAdd is associative)

  # --- Configuration ---

  @rq-111eb26d
  Scenario: max_neighbors in config is rejected at load
    Given a config file with [neighbor_list].max_neighbors = 1024
    When the simulation loads the config
    Then a configuration error is reported indicating max_neighbors is
      no longer a supported field

  @rq-38096442
  Scenario: tile_pair_growth_factor below 1.0 is rejected at load
    Given a config file with [neighbor_list].tile_pair_growth_factor = 0.9
    When the simulation loads the config
    Then a configuration error is reported indicating the growth factor
      must be greater than 1.0

  @rq-ea8640f5
  Scenario: Probe rebuild sizes capacity with headroom below the fill threshold
    Given a SPC water benchmark with 24,576 atoms
    When NeighborListState::new_cell_list constructs and the runner runs the
      pre-capture probe rebuild
    Then interacting_tiles_capacity is at least the count produced by that
      rebuild divided by tile_pair_fill_threshold
    And the tiles_high_water bit of neighbor_status is clear after the probe
    And interacting_tiles_capacity does not exceed that lower bound times
      tile_pair_growth_factor

  @rq-8d7e376d
  Scenario: Buffer footprint scales linearly with N, not quadratically
    Given two SPC water systems A with N_A atoms and B with N_B = 8 * N_A atoms
      at the same density
    When the pre-capture probe rebuild completes for each
    Then interacting_tiles_capacity for B is within a small constant factor of
      8 times interacting_tiles_capacity for A
    And no buffer is allocated with a length proportional to n_blocks squared

  @rq-36026b97
  Scenario: Capacity never preallocates the all-pairs upper bound
    Given a system with n_blocks atom-blocks
    When NeighborListState::new_cell_list constructs
    Then the seed length of interacting_tiles is far below
      n_blocks * n_blocks

  @rq-8b6d0c41
  Scenario: A rebuild grows the buffers when the interaction count rises
    Given a phase whose density increases under a barostat
    And a build whose entry count first crosses
      floor(interacting_tiles_capacity * tile_pair_fill_threshold)
    When the batch loop reads the tiles_high_water bit of neighbor_status
    Then interacting_tiles is reallocated to ceil(interacting_tiles_capacity * tile_pair_growth_factor)
    And a fresh rebuild populates the resized buffer
    And the rebuild's pre_step outcome reports reallocated = true

  @rq-25f8dd1d
  Scenario: Seed capacity is clamped to the all-pairs reference for tiny systems
    Given a system with n_blocks = 4 atom-blocks
    When NeighborListState::new_cell_list constructs
    Then default_interacting_tiles_capacity(4) equals 16 (= 4 * 4)
    And the seed is not the 128 * n_blocks density heuristic

  # --- Determinism of the excluded-pair list ---

  @rq-c123c82c
  Scenario: excluded_pair_atoms preserves canonical ExclusionList order
    Given the topology contains exclusions in canonical (atom_i < atom_j) order
    When ForceField::new constructs excluded_pair_atoms
    Then excluded_pair_atoms[2k] = ExclusionList.entries[k].atom_i for every k
    And excluded_pair_atoms[2k+1] = ExclusionList.entries[k].atom_j for every k
    And excluded_pair_count = ExclusionList.entries.len()

  @rq-30a85bc9
  Scenario: excluded_pair_atoms is constant across the simulation
    Given the topology does not change during the simulation
    When 1000 steps run
    Then excluded_pair_atoms is not modified after ForceField::new

  # --- Single-periodic-copy fast path ---

  @rq-7369ded0
  Scenario: Per-block SPC predicate is true when every axis margin exceeds MAX_CUTOFF
    Given an orthorhombic box with lattice lengths (L_x, L_y, L_z) = (100, 100, 100)
    And MAX_CUTOFF = 10
    And an i-block whose bbox half-extents (block_bbox[b]) are (5, 5, 5)
    When the packed-neighbour kernel processes i-block b

    And MAX_CUTOFF = 10
    And an i-block whose bbox half-extents (block_bbox[b]) are (5, 45, 5)
      so 0.5*L_y - block_bbox.y = 5 < MAX_CUTOFF

    Then the SPC predicate evaluates to false
    And the warp takes the per-pair min-image path

  @rq-fb310fbe
  Scenario: Per-block SPC predicate is boundary-true at exactly MAX_CUTOFF margin
    Given an orthorhombic box with lattice lengths (L_x, L_y, L_z) = (100, 100, 100)
    And MAX_CUTOFF = 10
    And an i-block whose bbox half-extents are (40, 40, 40)
      so 0.5*L_d - block_bbox.d = 10 = MAX_CUTOFF for every axis
    When the packed-neighbour kernel processes i-block b
    Then the SPC predicate evaluates to true

  @rq-432c52f5
  Scenario: Triclinic boxes are SPC-ineligible regardless of bbox extent
    Given a SimulationBox whose lattice has any of xy, xz, yz non-zero
    When the packed-neighbour kernel processes any i-block
    Then the SPC predicate evaluates to false
    And the warp takes the per-pair min-image path

  @rq-fe6b054a
  Scenario: SPC predicate is uniform across the warp
    Given the packed-neighbour kernel processes any i-block
    When all 32 lanes of the warp evaluate the SPC predicate
    Then every lane observes the same boolean value
    And the kernel branches once warp-wide without per-lane divergence

  @rq-df787c57
  Scenario: SPC fast path wraps pi and pj against the i-block centre
    Given the SPC predicate is true for i-block b with centre c = block_centre[b]
    When the warp loads pi for any lane from tile_sorted_posq
    Then pi is shifted in-register to the periodic image satisfying |pi - c|_axis <= L_axis / 2
    And every per-entry j-atom's pj loaded from posq is shifted to satisfy |pj - c|_axis <= L_axis / 2
    And no further shift is applied to pi or pj during the 32-iteration inner loop

  @rq-e39a87c1
  Scenario: SPC fast path inner loop skips triclinic_min_image
    Given the SPC predicate is true for the i-block currently being processed
    When the inner loop iteration evaluates dx = pi - pj
    Then heddle_jit_triclinic_min_image is not invoked for this iteration
    And r2 = dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz is computed from dx, dy, dz directly

  @rq-e1717060
  Scenario: Min-image branch is taken when the predicate is false
    Given the SPC predicate is false for the i-block currently being processed
    When the inner loop iteration evaluates dx = pi - pj
    Then heddle_jit_triclinic_min_image is invoked once for this iteration before r2 is computed
    And neither pi nor pj is centre-wrapped

  @rq-05b5b488
  Scenario: A box where every i-block qualifies matches the all-min-image run bit-for-bit
    Given a simulation in which the SPC predicate is true for every i-block of every step
    And a comparator run on the same hardware that disables the SPC branch and always takes min-image
    When both runs perform one ForceField::step(Fast)
    Then ParticleBuffers.forces_x, forces_y, forces_z compare byte-identical across the two runs after finalize_fast_class_forces

  @rq-c469b2e8
  Scenario: NPT box transition flips SPC eligibility without graph re-capture
    Given a CUDA-graph-captured phase in which every i-block had SPC true at capture time
    And a subsequent step in which the box shrinks so 0.5*L_d - block_bbox.d < MAX_CUTOFF for some block on some axis
    When the captured graph replays the same packed-neighbour kernel call
    Then the kernel evaluates the SPC predicate from the current lattice and block_bbox values at every i-block
    And every affected i-block takes the per-pair min-image path on this replay
    And no graph invalidation or re-capture is triggered

  Scenario: Single-pair and exclusion-correction passes unaffected by SPC
    Given any simulation step
    When the single-pair pass and the exclusion-correction pass run
    Then both passes invoke heddle_jit_triclinic_min_image for every pair they evaluate
    And neither pass reads block_centre or block_bbox

  # --- Out of scope ---

  @rq-92b63da0
  Scenario: f64 build refuses to instantiate the packed-neighbour kernel
    Given the project is compiled with feature "f64"
    When ForceField::new is called for a fast-class pair-force pipeline
    Then construction returns an error indicating that the packed-
      neighbour kernel does not yet support f64
