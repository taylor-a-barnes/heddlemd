# Feature: Morse Bonded Potential <!-- rq-05d55351 -->

The `MorseBonded` potential slot evaluates a Morse bond force for each bond
in the system's bond list (see `topology.md`). Bonds are pairs of atoms whose
distance interaction is described by the Morse functional form with
per-bond-type parameters. The slot plugs into the pluggable potential
framework (`framework.md`); selection is implicit — the slot is present
whenever the config's `topology` field references a non-empty `.topology`
file whose `[bonds]` section is non-empty and at least one
`[[bond_types]]` entry has `potential = "morse"`.

## Algorithm <!-- rq-cbeeea3c -->

The Morse pair potential between atoms `i` and `j` at separation
`r = |r_i - r_j|` is

```text
U(r) = D_e * (1 - exp(-a * (r - r_e)))^2
F(r) = -dU/dr = 2 * D_e * a * (1 - exp(-a * (r - r_e))) * exp(-a * (r - r_e))
```

where the bond-type parameters are `D_e` (well depth, J), `a` (width
parameter, 1/m), and `r_e` (equilibrium distance, m). The minimum-image
displacement between the two atoms is used so the kernel honours
periodic boundary conditions; the bond is *not* truncated by any cutoff
distance — Morse is intended for short-range bonded use where atoms
remain near equilibrium.

For bond `k` connecting `atom_i` and `atom_j`, the kernel computes the
direction vector `d_hat = (r_i - r_j) / r` (the minimum-image
displacement, normalised) and the scalar force magnitude `F(r)`. The
force on `atom_i` is `+F * d_hat`; the force on `atom_j` is `-F * d_hat`
(Newton's third law applied at the kernel level). The two contributions
are written to consecutive slots in the bond-pair buffer (see *Force
Accumulation* below).

## Per-Step Kernel Sequence <!-- rq-100f8b5f -->

The slot's contribution kernel and reduction kernel run once each per
step:

| Step | Kernel | Operation | Stage label |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `morse_bond_force` | compute force per bond, write to bond-pair buffer | `MorseBondForce` |
| 2 | `reduce_bond_forces` | per-atom sum of bond contributions, write to slot accumulator | `ReduceBondForces` |

The combiner (`AccumulateForces`) is run by the framework after every
slot's reduction. See `framework.md` for the slot order.

## Force Accumulation <!-- rq-0c318e64 -->

The slot owns a `BondPairBuffer` of length `2 * B` where `B` is the
number of bonds. Each slot carries five `f32` quantities: three force
components, half-energy, and half-virial. Slot `2 * k` holds atom `i`'s
share of bond `k`; slot `2 * k + 1` holds atom `j`'s share. The
half-energy and half-virial conventions match the pair-buffer convention
(see `pair-force-kernel.md`): each slot writes `U_k / 2` and `W_k / 2` so
the system total sum over slots equals `Σ_k U_k` and `Σ_k W_k`
respectively, counting each bond exactly once.

The reduction kernel reads the precomputed `atom_bond_offsets` /
`atom_bond_indices` tables (see `topology.md`) and sums each atom's
contributions in fixed order. For atom `a`, the kernel computes five
sequential left-to-right sums:

```text
slot_force_x[a]  = sum over k in atom_bond_indices[a] of bond_pair_x[k]
slot_force_y[a]  = same with y
slot_force_z[a]  = same with z
slot_energy[a]   = sum over k in atom_bond_indices[a] of bond_pair_energy[k]
slot_virial[a]   = sum over k in atom_bond_indices[a] of bond_pair_virial[k]
```

The `atom_bond_indices` slice for each atom is sorted by underlying
bond index at file-load time, so the summation order is identical across
runs. Each thread maps to one atom; there are no atomics and no race
conditions.

## Parameters <!-- rq-12872970 -->

Each `[[bond_types]]` entry in the config that uses `potential = "morse"`
contributes one row to a per-bond-type parameter table uploaded to the
device:

- `de: f64` — well depth, Hartrees (`E_h`). Required. Finite and
  strictly positive.
- `a: f64` — width parameter, inverse Bohr (`1/a_0`). Required.
  Finite and strictly positive.
- `re: f64` — equilibrium distance, Bohr (`a_0`). Required. Finite and
  strictly positive.

The parameter table on the device is three `CudaSlice<f32>` arrays
(`de`, `a`, `re`), one per bond type, cast from `f64` to `f32` at
upload time. Each bond carries a `bond_type_index` (see `topology.md`)
into this table.

In v1 the only supported `potential` value for bond types is `"morse"`;
other values are rejected at config-load time. Future bonded potentials
(harmonic, cosine, etc.) will add new `potential` values and reuse the
existing `BondList` / `BondPairBuffer` / reduction infrastructure.

## Empty State <!-- rq-21acd57c -->

When the bond list is empty (`bond_list.is_empty()`), the
`MorseBondedState` is not constructed by the `ForceField` and the slot
is absent from the slot list. The framework's combiner handles
slot-presence correctly (see `framework.md`).

When `particle_count == 0`, the bond list must also be empty (the file
parser rejects any bond entry with an out-of-range atom index, and
every index is out of range when `N == 0`). The slot is therefore not
constructed.

## Feature API <!-- rq-345d7784 -->

### Types <!-- rq-976aa4af -->

- `MorseBondedState` — implements the `Potential` trait with <!-- rq-ec18d174 -->
  `label() == "morse_bonded"` (see `framework.md`). Fields:
  - `device: Arc<CudaDevice>`
  - `bonds: CudaSlice<u32>` — flat array of `[atom_i, atom_j,
    bond_type_index]` triples, length `3 * B`, sorted to match
    `BondList::bonds`.
  - `atom_bond_offsets: CudaSlice<u32>` — length `N + 1`.
  - `atom_bond_indices: CudaSlice<u32>` — length `2 * B`.
  - `bond_de: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `n_bond_types`.
  - `bond_a: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `n_bond_types`.
  - `bond_re: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `n_bond_types`.
  - `bond_pair_x: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `2 * B`, per-slot force x
    contribution.
  - `bond_pair_y: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `2 * B`.
  - `bond_pair_z: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `2 * B`.
  - `bond_pair_energy: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `2 * B`, per-slot
    half-energy contribution (`U_k / 2`).
  - `bond_pair_virial: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `2 * B`, per-slot
    half-virial contribution (`W_k / 2`).
  - `bond_count: usize`
  - `particle_count: usize`

  All fields private; the slot's public surface is the per-step methods
  invoked by `ForceField::step` (see `framework.md`).

  Constructor:

  - `MorseBondedState::new(device: Arc<CudaDevice>, bond_list: &BondList, bond_types: &[BondTypeConfig]) -> Result<MorseBondedState, GpuError>`
    - Filters `bond_types` to entries with `potential == "morse"` and
      uploads their parameters.
    - Uploads `bond_list.bonds`, `bond_list.atom_bond_offsets`, and
      `bond_list.atom_bond_indices` to device memory.
    - Allocates the five per-bond `bond_pair_*` buffers (force x/y/z,
      half-energy, half-virial), each of length `2 * B`. Per-atom
      output is added into the framework-supplied `SlotOutputView`
      (a view onto the slot's class accumulator; see `framework.md`'s
      *Class Output Accumulators*) during `reduce()`; the slot owns no
      per-atom accumulator buffers of its own.
    - When `bond_list.is_empty()`, this method is not called by the
      `ForceField` — see *Empty State*.

### CUDA Kernels <!-- rq-d28ad917 -->

`kernels/morse.cu` declares two `extern "C"` kernels:

```c
extern "C" __global__ void morse_bond_force(
    const float *positions_x, const float *positions_y, const float *positions_z,
    const unsigned int *bonds,
    const float *bond_de, const float *bond_a, const float *bond_re,
    const float *lattice,           // length 6: [lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz]
    float *bond_pair_x, float *bond_pair_y, float *bond_pair_z,
    float *bond_pair_energy, float *bond_pair_virial,
    unsigned int n_bonds);

extern "C" __global__ void reduce_bond_forces(
    const float *bond_pair_x, const float *bond_pair_y, const float *bond_pair_z,
    const float *bond_pair_energy, const float *bond_pair_virial,
    const unsigned int *atom_bond_offsets,
    const unsigned int *atom_bond_indices,
    float *slot_force_x, float *slot_force_y, float *slot_force_z,
    float *slot_energy, float *slot_virial,
    unsigned int n);
```

#### `morse_bond_force` <!-- rq-39cec761 -->

One thread per bond. Thread `k`:

1. Reads `atom_i`, `atom_j`, `type_idx` from `bonds[3*k .. 3*k + 3]`.
2. Computes the minimum-image displacement
   `(dx, dy, dz) = (r_i - r_j)` wrapped against the six lattice
   parameters `(lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz)` via the triclinic tilt-
   subtraction algorithm defined in `simulation-box.md`. For an
   orthorhombic box this reduces to three independent per-axis wraps.
3. Computes `r2 = dx² + dy² + dz²` and `r = sqrt(r2)`.
4. Reads `De = bond_de[type_idx]`, `a = bond_a[type_idx]`,
   `re = bond_re[type_idx]`.
5. Computes `e = exp(-a * (r - re))` and the force magnitude
   `Fmag = 2 * De * a * (1 - e) * e / r` (the trailing `/ r` produces
   the per-component factor when multiplied by `(dx, dy, dz)`).
6. Computes the bond's potential energy
   `U_k = De * (1 - e)^2` and the bond's scalar virial
   `W_k = Fmag * r2` (equivalent to `r · F` with `F` aligned along
   `(dx, dy, dz)`).
7. Writes the force on `atom_i` to `bond_pair_*[2 * k]` as
   `Fmag * (dx, dy, dz)`.
8. Writes the force on `atom_j` to `bond_pair_*[2 * k + 1]` as
   `-Fmag * (dx, dy, dz)`.
9. Writes `U_k * 0.5f` to both `bond_pair_energy[2 * k]` and
   `bond_pair_energy[2 * k + 1]`.
10. Writes `W_k * 0.5f` to both `bond_pair_virial[2 * k]` and
    `bond_pair_virial[2 * k + 1]`.

When `r == 0` exactly (degenerate overlapping atoms), the kernel writes
`0` to all ten slots (five quantities × two slots) rather than producing
NaN. This is a defensive guard; physical Morse simulations never reach
`r == 0` because the exponential blows up at small `r`.

#### `reduce_bond_forces` <!-- rq-b2559e09 -->

One thread per atom `a = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x` (block
size 256, grid `ceil(n / 256)`). Thread `a`:

1. Reads `start = atom_bond_offsets[a]` and `end =
   atom_bond_offsets[a + 1]`.
2. Initialises five running sums to zero: `sum_x`, `sum_y`, `sum_z`,
   `sum_e`, `sum_w`.
3. For each `i` in `start .. end`:
   `slot = atom_bond_indices[i];
    sum_x += bond_pair_x[slot];  (similarly y, z)
    sum_e += bond_pair_energy[slot];
    sum_w += bond_pair_virial[slot];`.
4. Writes the five output slices at index `a`:
   `slot_force_x[a] = sum_x; slot_force_y[a] = sum_y;
    slot_force_z[a] = sum_z; slot_energy[a] = sum_e;
    slot_virial[a] = sum_w`.

The summation is left-to-right in `atom_bond_indices` order. Since
the indices are sorted at load time, the order is deterministic.

### PTX Module Loading <!-- rq-aa36ee0b -->

`init_device()` loads the compiled `kernels/morse.cu` PTX as module
`"morse"` and captures its `morse_bond_force` and `reduce_bond_forces`
functions into the `Kernels` handle (see `build-pipeline.md`).

### Rust Launch Helpers <!-- rq-637c4fdd -->

Two free functions in `src/gpu/kernels.rs`, re-exported from
`crate::gpu`:

- `morse_bond_force(state: &mut MorseBondedState, particle_buffers: &ParticleBuffers, sim_box: &SimulationBox) -> Result<(), GpuError>` <!-- rq-66d80d54 -->
  - Launches the `morse_bond_force` kernel, writing per-slot force,
    half-energy, and half-virial into the state's `bond_pair_*` fields.
  - Block size 256; grid size `ceil(state.bond_count / 256)`.
  - Returns `Ok(())` without launching when `state.bond_count == 0`.
  - Invokes the kernel through the `Kernels` handle reached from its
    arguments; it performs no string-keyed kernel lookup of its own (see
    `build-pipeline.md`).

- `reduce_bond_forces(state: &mut MorseBondedState, output_force_x: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>, output_force_y: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>, output_force_z: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>, output_energy: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>, output_virial: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>) -> Result<(), GpuError>` <!-- rq-10adebc4 -->
  - Launches the `reduce_bond_forces` kernel, summing each atom's bond
    contributions into the five caller-supplied output views (force x,
    force y, force z, energy share, virial share). Output views have
    length `state.particle_count`.
  - Block size 256; grid size `ceil(state.particle_count / 256)`.
  - Returns `Ok(())` without launching when
    `state.particle_count == 0`.
  - Invokes the kernel through the `Kernels` handle, like
    `morse_bond_force`.

## Launch Configuration <!-- rq-c1678fe1 -->

- Block size: 256 threads for both kernels.
- Grid size: `ceil(bond_count / 256)` for the force kernel,
  `ceil(particle_count / 256)` for the reduction.
- Shared memory: zero bytes.
- Stream: the default stream carried by `particle_buffers.device`.

## Determinism <!-- rq-e5ba2e00 -->

- Each bond's force is computed by exactly one thread; no atomics.
- Each atom's reduction is computed by exactly one thread; sums
  proceed in sorted `atom_bond_indices` order.
- Two runs with identical bonds, parameters, and positions on the same
  GPU produce byte-identical `bond_pair_*` and `accumulator_*`
  contents.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-c79e35dc -->

- Other bonded potentials (harmonic bonds, FENE, Buckingham, etc.).
  Each lands as a new `potential` value in `[[bond_types]]` with its
  own kernel.
- Angle, dihedral, and improper potentials.
- Per-bond parameter overrides (every bond gets its parameters via its
  bond type).
- Long-range / cutoff variants of Morse. Morse is treated as
  full-range bonded.
- A "soft" Morse variant that smoothly switches off for large `r`.
- Bond breaking, forming, or reordering during a simulation.
