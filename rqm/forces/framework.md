# Feature: Pluggable Potential Slot Framework <!-- rq-c1ea073b -->

The runner evaluates inter-particle forces through an ordered collection of
*potential slots* assembled into a `ForceField`. Each slot implements the
`Potential` trait, which exposes a single `compute` method and a
per-axis output destination of length `particle_count`. The
`ForceField`'s `step()` method runs every slot's `compute` in slot
order and combines their outputs into the particle state's `forces_*` arrays
via a deterministic combiner kernel. The runner's force-evaluation step
calls `force_field.step(...)` once; it has no visibility into which
potentials participated.

A `PotentialRegistry` of `PotentialBuilder`s drives slot construction.
Each builder is an open-extensible factory that decides, from a parsed-config
+ topology context, whether it contributes a slot and (if so) constructs
one. `ForceField::new` is a fixed loop over the registry: it iterates the
builders in registration order, calls each builder's `build(cx)`, and
appends the returned slot when `Some(_)`. Adding a new built-in potential
is a one-line edit to `PotentialRegistry::with_builtins()`. Implementing
a new `Potential` requires no edits to `ForceField::new`, to the combiner
kernel, or to any other potential's code.

Every slot belongs to one *frequency class* (`ForceClass::Fast` or
`ForceClass::Slow`) reported by its `Potential::frequency_class()`
method. The framework exposes two force-evaluation entry points:
`ForceField::step(...)` re-evaluates every slot regardless of class, and
`ForceField::step_class(class, ...)` re-evaluates only slots whose class
matches. Both entry points re-run the combiner across every class so
`ParticleBuffers.forces_*`, `potential_energies`, and `virials` always
hold the most recent total. The class system carries the framework's
support for multi-time-step (RESPA-style) integrators that want to
evaluate slow forces (e.g. SPME reciprocal-space) less often than fast
forces (e.g. short-range pair).

## Slots <!-- rq-cc73f184 -->

`PotentialRegistry::with_builtins()` registers six built-in `PotentialBuilder`s,
each of which contributes one slot to the `ForceField` when its activation
condition is met. The registry's registration order is the slot evaluation
order; the registry is the single canonical source of slot ordering, and
`ForceField::new` reads from it without making its own decisions.

| Builder | `label()` of the slot it builds | Activation condition (`build(cx)` returns `Some(_)` iff …) | `frequency_class()` | Implementation file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LennardJonesBuilder` | `"lennard_jones"` | `cx.pair_interactions` is non-empty | `Fast` | `lj-pair-force.md` |
| `CoulombBuilder` | `"coulomb"` | `cx.coulomb_config.is_some()` | `Fast` | `coulomb-pair-force.md` |
| `SpmeRealBuilder` | `"spme_real"` | `cx.spme_config.is_some()` | `Fast` | `spme.md` |
| `SpmeReciprocalBuilder` | `"spme_reciprocal"` | `cx.spme_config.is_some()` | `Slow` | `spme.md` |
| `MorseBondedBuilder` | `"morse_bonded"` | `!cx.bond_list.is_empty()` | `Fast` | `morse-bonded.md` |
| `HarmonicAngleBuilder` | `"harmonic_angle"` | `!cx.angle_list.is_empty()` | `Fast` | `harmonic-angle.md` |

The two SPME builders share the same activation condition; they always
appear together because the Ewald split is exact only when both halves
are evaluated. The `[coulomb]` and `[spme]` tables are mutually exclusive
at config load (see `io/config-schema.md`); a `ForceField` therefore
contains at most one electrostatics path.

A `ForceField` with zero slots is a valid configuration. `step()` writes
zeros into `particle_buffers.forces_*` and returns without launching any
slot kernels.

When multiple slots are present, they appear in the `ForceField`'s slot
list in the order their builders are registered. The canonical built-in
order is the order of the six rows above:

1. `LennardJones`
2. `Coulomb`
3. `SpmeRealSpace`
4. `SpmeReciprocal`
5. `MorseBonded`
6. `HarmonicAngle`

A built-in potential is added by writing a `PotentialBuilder` and inserting
it at the appropriate position in `PotentialRegistry::with_builtins()`.
The `ForceField::new` body does not change.

## Force Classes <!-- rq-df6d79a1 -->

`ForceClass` is a two-variant enum that partitions every slot into one of
two evaluation cadences:

- `Fast` — short-range and inexpensive contributions: short-range pair
  forces (LJ, Coulomb, SPME real-space), bonded pair forces, three-body
  angle forces. A RESPA-style integrator evaluates Fast slots once per
  inner step.
- `Slow` — long-range and expensive contributions: SPME reciprocal-space
  (the FFT pipeline). A RESPA-style integrator evaluates Slow slots once
  per outer step.

Every concrete `Potential` reports its class via
`Potential::frequency_class()`. The default implementation returns
`ForceClass::Fast`; only `SpmeReciprocalState` overrides to `Slow`. A
user-defined `Potential` that does not override `frequency_class()` is
treated as `Fast`, which is the right default for short-range / bonded /
intramolecular contributions.

A `ForceField` populates a per-class slot-output buffer set when its
matching evaluation entry point runs:

- `ForceField::step(...)` re-evaluates every slot in slot order,
  refreshing every per-class buffer, then runs the combiner.
- `ForceField::step_class(class, ...)` re-evaluates only slots whose
  class matches, refreshing that class's buffer, then runs the combiner.
  Non-matching slots' buffers retain their last-written contents.

In both cases the combiner sums per-particle contributions across every
class into `ParticleBuffers.forces_*`, `potential_energies`, and
`virials`. Single-step integrators emit a `SubStep::ForceEval` with
`class: None` and consume the total; multi-step (RESPA) integrators emit
`class: Some(Fast)` many times and `class: Some(Slow)` once per outer
step, and the per-particle total visible at each kick reflects the most
recent evaluation of every class — Slow contributions are stale by up to
`n − 1` inner steps, exactly the RESPA approximation.

The two SPME builders contribute slots in different classes (Real → Fast,
Reciprocal → Slow). The Ewald split remains exact only when both classes
have been evaluated at the same simulation time; integrators that mix
`step_class(Fast)` calls with stale Slow contributions are using the
RESPA approximation, not a different splitting of the Ewald sum.

## Force Evaluation Pipeline <!-- rq-7bab5c1e -->

Each `ForceField::step(...)` or `ForceField::step_class(class, ...)`
call performs the following, in order:

1. **Shared neighbor-list update.** If `ForceField::neighbor_list` is
   `Some`, call its `pre_step` method (see `neighbor-list.md`). In
   cell-list mode this runs the displacement-check kernel and rebuilds
   the neighbor list when an atom's reference displacement exceeds
   `r_skin / 2`. In trivial mode and when `neighbor_list` is `None`,
   this step launches no kernels. The update runs at the cadence of
   whichever entry point is called: every `step` / `step_class` call
   may trigger a rebuild.
2. **Class filter.** Restrict the slot iteration to slots whose
   `frequency_class()` matches the entry-point's class selector:
   - `step(...)` and `step_class(None, ...)` (when offered as `step`'s
     default) iterate every slot.
   - `step_class(class, ...)` iterates only slots whose
     `frequency_class() == class`.
3. **Per-slot compute.** For each selected slot, in canonical slot
   order, invoke `Potential::compute`, passing a `ForceFieldContext`
   that carries a reference to the shared `NeighborListState` (when
   present) and any other shared services, a `SlotOutputView` that
   points to the slot's assigned row of its class's flat slot-output
   buffers, and the call's `AggregateLevel`. The implementation runs
   whatever kernel(s) it needs to evaluate its contribution and writes
   directly into the SlotOutputView: it overwrites the three
   force-component rows on every call regardless of level, and
   additionally overwrites the energy and virial rows when
   `level == AggregateLevel::ForcesAndScalars`. When
   `level == AggregateLevel::ForcesOnly`, the energy and virial rows
   for the just-computed slot retain whatever values the most recent
   `ForcesAndScalars` call wrote into them. Slots whose internal
   kernels cannot cheaply split along the force / energy-virial
   boundary (today: every bonded slot, e.g. `MorseBondedState`,
   `HarmonicAngleState`) write all five quantities on every call
   regardless of level.
4. **Combiner.** Run `accumulate_forces` once. The combiner reads
   every class's slot-output buffers and writes, for each per-particle
   quantity `Q` in `{force_x, force_y, force_z, potential_energy,
   virial}`:
   `particle_buffers.Q[i] = sum over all (class, k) in canonical class+slot order of class_slot_Q[k * n + i]`.
   The summation is left-to-right with classes ordered Fast, then Slow,
   and within each class by registration order; each thread handles
   one `i`. Unselected slots' rows and rows whose energy / virial
   contents were not refreshed by step 3 (`ForcesOnly` runs) still
   contribute their last-written values, so the aggregated
   `potential_energies` and `virials` on `ParticleBuffers` reflect the
   most recent `ForcesAndScalars` evaluation across every class. The
   combiner runs on every `step` / `step_class` call regardless of
   level; the level only affects which slot-output rows step 3
   refreshes.

Identical runs on the same GPU with the same config and the same
sequence of `step` / `step_class` calls — including the same
`AggregateLevel` value at each call site — produce byte-identical
`particle_buffers.forces_*`, `potential_energies`, and `virials`, and
therefore byte-identical trajectories. A change in the cadence at
which `ForcesAndScalars` versus `ForcesOnly` is requested is a
configuration change, not a non-determinism: two runs that issue the
same sequence of (call kind, level) pairs are reproducible; two runs
that differ in that sequence produce different `potential_energies`
and `virials` at the steps where they diverge, exactly as expected.

## Slot Output Buffers <!-- rq-cd28340e -->

`ForceField` owns five contiguous device buffers per force class —
`fast_slot_forces_x`, `fast_slot_forces_y`, `fast_slot_forces_z`,
`fast_slot_energies`, `fast_slot_virials` for `Fast`, and the matching
`slow_*` set for `Slow`. Each class's buffer has length
`num_slots_in_class * particle_count`. Within a class, the row for the
`k`-th slot of that class (in canonical registration order, filtered to
that class) is the half-open range
`[k * particle_count, (k + 1) * particle_count)`.

After slot `k`'s `compute()` returns, row `k` of its class's buffers
contains that slot's per-particle reduced contribution along that axis
or scalar quantity: three force components, one potential-energy share,
and one scalar-virial share. The combiner reads every class's rows in
canonical class+slot order (`Fast` first, then `Slow`; within each
class, registration order) and sums them, producing the five
per-particle aggregates on `ParticleBuffers`.

Memory cost: `5 * (num_fast_slots + num_slow_slots) * particle_count * 4
bytes`, which equals the single-buffer cost from before the class split
because `num_fast_slots + num_slow_slots == slots.len()`. For
`particle_count = 10⁴` and four slots, this is ~800 KB — negligible.
For `particle_count = 10⁵` and four slots, ~8 MB.

When a class has zero slots its five buffers have length zero. When
`particle_count == 0` every class's buffers have length zero regardless
of slot counts. Class-output buffers are zero-initialised at
construction so that the combiner reads valid zero contributions for
any class that has not yet been evaluated.

## Empty State <!-- rq-aa52268c -->

When `particle_count == 0`, every slot's `compute` method
early-returns without launching, and the combiner returns without
launching. `ForceField::step` and `ForceField::step_class` return
`Ok(())` having done no GPU work.

When the slot list is empty (across every class), the combiner kernel
still launches (with all class counts equal to zero) and writes zeros
to every entry of `particle_buffers.forces_*`, `potential_energies`,
and `virials`. The compute phase launches no kernels. `ForceField::step`
returns `Ok(())`.

When `step_class(class, ...)` is called and the `ForceField` contains
zero slots in that class, the call is a no-op: it launches no kernels
(no compute, no combiner) and leaves `ParticleBuffers.forces_*`
untouched. The semantics are correct because nothing to recompute
means the existing total is already current.

When a slot's *input list* is empty (e.g. a `MorseBonded` slot
constructed with `bonds.is_empty()`), the slot's `compute` writes
zeros into its assigned rows of its class's slot-output buffers
without launching any other kernel, and the rest of the pipeline runs
normally. (The combiner reads every row unconditionally; empty-input
slots must carry valid zeros in their rows.)

## Feature API <!-- rq-0da87ca1 -->

### Types <!-- rq-e4960f89 -->

- `ForceClass` — two-variant enum partitioning every slot into one of <!-- rq-c4861786 -->
  two evaluation cadences.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
  pub enum ForceClass {
      Fast,
      Slow,
  }
  ```

  - `Fast` is the default class returned by `Potential::frequency_class()`.
  - `Slow` is for long-range / FFT-driven contributions (today: SPME
    reciprocal-space). RESPA integrators evaluate `Slow` slots less
    frequently than `Fast` slots.
  - The set of variants is closed. Extending to a third class (e.g.
    RESPA-3's "extra-slow") is a deliberate API change, not a default
    extension point.

- `AggregateLevel` — two-variant enum that selects whether the <!-- inline --> <!-- rq-81ac7d6a -->
  framework's per-step force-evaluation pipeline aggregates only the
  force components or also the scalar quantities (energy, virial).

  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
  pub enum AggregateLevel {
      ForcesOnly,
      ForcesAndScalars,
  }
  ```

  - `ForcesOnly` (the cheap case, ~3/5 of the per-call reduction work)
    runs only the force-component reductions. The energy and virial
    rows of every slot-output buffer retain whatever values the most
    recent `ForcesAndScalars` call wrote into them.
  - `ForcesAndScalars` runs both the force-component reductions and
    the scalar (energy + virial) reductions.
  - The variant set is closed. Adding a third level requires editing
    every consumer; it is not an open extension point.

- `Potential` — object-safe trait implemented by every slot. <!-- rq-67ebf3b1 -->

  ```rust
  pub trait Potential: std::fmt::Debug + Send {
      fn label(&self) -> &'static str;

      fn max_cutoff(&self) -> Option<f32>;

      fn frequency_class(&self) -> ForceClass {
          ForceClass::Fast
      }

      fn compute(
          &mut self,
          buffers: &ParticleBuffers,
          sim_box: &SimulationBox,
          output: SlotOutputView<'_>,
          cx: &ForceFieldContext<'_>,
          timings: &mut Timings,
          level: AggregateLevel,
      ) -> Result<(), ForceFieldError>;
  }
  ```

  - `label` returns a short, stable, lower-snake-case identifier (for
    example `"lennard_jones"`, `"morse_bonded"`) used in error messages
    and diagnostic output. Two slots in the same `ForceField` must have
    distinct labels.
  - `max_cutoff` returns the maximum short-range interaction cutoff the
    potential needs the shared neighbor list to cover, in the same units
    as `SimulationBox`. Returns `None` if the potential does not consume
    the neighbor list (bonded potentials, intramolecular potentials
    keyed by index, etc.). `ForceField::new` aggregates these values to
    size the shared `NeighborListState`.
  - `frequency_class` reports the class at which the framework should
    evaluate this slot. Provided default returns `ForceClass::Fast`;
    only slots whose contribution is expensive enough to justify a
    different cadence override. Today only `SpmeReciprocalState`
    overrides, returning `ForceClass::Slow`.
  - `compute` runs the slot's evaluation kernel(s) against the current
    `ParticleBuffers` and `SimulationBox` and writes the per-particle
    result directly into `output`. The slot reads any shared resources
    it needs from `cx`. Implementations may read from `buffers` but
    must not write to it. Implementations that report
    `max_cutoff() == Some(_)` may assume `cx.neighbor_list` is
    `Some(_)`; implementations that report `None` are free to ignore
    `cx.neighbor_list` (it may be `None` or `Some` depending on whether
    any other slot needs the list).

    `compute` writes exactly `buffers.particle_count()` floats into
    each of the three force-component slices referenced by `output` on
    every call regardless of `level`. When `level == AggregateLevel::ForcesAndScalars`
    the implementation additionally writes `buffers.particle_count()`
    floats into the energy and virial slices. When `level == AggregateLevel::ForcesOnly`
    the energy and virial slices are not written. Slot implementations
    that cannot cheaply split along the force / scalar boundary
    (today: every bonded slot, e.g. `MorseBondedState`,
    `HarmonicAngleState`) write all five quantities on every call
    regardless of `level` — the cost is small and the behaviour is
    indistinguishable from `ForcesAndScalars` for that slot.

  Implementations are responsible for emitting their own
  `KernelStage` start/stop events through `timings`.

- `ForceFieldContext<'a>` — bundle of shared services that the framework <!-- inline --> <!-- rq-559783fe -->
  exposes to every `compute` call. Constructed by `ForceField::step`
  for the duration of one step's compute phase. Fields:

  ```rust
  pub struct ForceFieldContext<'a> {
      pub neighbor_list: Option<&'a NeighborListState>,
  }
  ```

  - `neighbor_list` is `Some(_)` when at least one slot reports
    `max_cutoff() == Some(_)` at construction; otherwise `None`. New
    shared services land here as additional fields without changing the
    `Potential::compute` signature.

- `SlotOutputView<'a>` — five exclusive references to per-particle output <!-- rq-304b191b -->
  slices, each of length `particle_count`. Constructed by `ForceField`
  and passed into `Potential::compute`. Implementations must treat the
  slices as write-only output buffers.

  ```rust
  pub struct SlotOutputView<'a> {
      pub force_x: CudaViewMut<'a, f32>,
      pub force_y: CudaViewMut<'a, f32>,
      pub force_z: CudaViewMut<'a, f32>,
      pub energy: CudaViewMut<'a, f32>,
      pub virial: CudaViewMut<'a, f32>,
  }
  ```

  Each field is a `CudaViewMut` of length `particle_count` onto the
  corresponding row of one of the framework's per-class flat
  slot-output buffers (the class is determined by the slot's
  `frequency_class()`). The view borrows the framework's storage for
  the duration of the `compute` call.

- `LennardJonesState` — implements `Potential` with `label() == "lennard_jones"` and `frequency_class() == ForceClass::Fast` (the trait default). <!-- rq-af2d1628 -->
  Owns the slot's `LennardJonesParameters` and the
  `DeviceExclusionList` (see `topology.md`). Its internal state is one
  of two variants determined at construction time by the parsed
  `NeighborListConfig`:
  - `AllPairs` — additionally carries a `neighbor_counts` device slice
    with every entry equal to `N`. `max_neighbors == N`.
  - `CellList` — additionally carries a `NeighborListState` (see
    `neighbor-list.md`) that owns the cell list, neighbor list,
    reference positions, and overflow flag. `max_neighbors` comes from
    the config; `neighbor_counts` is populated per-rebuild by the
    neighbor-list build kernel.

  In either variant, the slot's `compute` runs the fused
  `lj_pair_force_f` or `lj_pair_force_fev` kernel (depending on the
  call's `AggregateLevel`) and writes its per-particle output
  directly into the `SlotOutputView` it receives. See
  `pair-force-kernel.md` for the warp-per-particle pattern and
  `lj-pair-force.md` for the per-pair functional form.

- `MorseBondedState` — implements `Potential` with `label() == "morse_bonded"` and `frequency_class() == ForceClass::Fast` (the trait default). <!-- rq-2361f2b8 -->
  Owns the slot's `BondPairBuffer`, the bond index/offset tables, and
  the per-bond-type parameter table. Construction requires a non-empty
  bond list; see `morse-bonded.md`. Its `compute` runs the bonded
  contribution kernel followed by the bonded reduction kernel and
  writes its per-particle output into the `SlotOutputView` it receives.

- `HarmonicAngleState` — implements `Potential` with `label() == "harmonic_angle"` and `frequency_class() == ForceClass::Fast` (the trait default). <!-- rq-454ad2cf -->
  Owns the slot's `AnglePairBuffer`, the angle index/offset tables,
  and the per-angle-type parameter table. Construction requires a
  non-empty angle list; see `harmonic-angle.md`. Its `compute` runs
  the angle contribution kernel followed by the angle reduction kernel
  and writes its per-particle output into the `SlotOutputView` it
  receives.

- `ForceField` — handle owning the slot collection, the per-class flat slot-output buffers, and the shared neighbor list. <!-- rq-684a29f1 -->

  Fields:
  - `device: Arc<CudaDevice>`
  - `slots: Vec<Box<dyn Potential>>` — in canonical evaluation order
    (the order produced by `PotentialRegistry::with_builtins()`). May
    be empty.
  - `fast_slot_forces_x: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_fast_slots * N`.
  - `fast_slot_forces_y: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_fast_slots * N`.
  - `fast_slot_forces_z: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_fast_slots * N`.
  - `fast_slot_energies: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_fast_slots * N`.
  - `fast_slot_virials: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_fast_slots * N`.
  - `slow_slot_forces_x: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_slow_slots * N`.
  - `slow_slot_forces_y: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_slow_slots * N`.
  - `slow_slot_forces_z: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_slow_slots * N`.
  - `slow_slot_energies: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_slow_slots * N`.
  - `slow_slot_virials: CudaSlice<f32>` — length `num_slow_slots * N`.
  - `neighbor_list: Option<NeighborListState>` — `Some(_)` when at
    least one slot returns `max_cutoff() == Some(_)`, `None`
    otherwise (bonded-only and zero-slot configurations).

  Within each class, the row index of a slot is its position among
  same-class slots in the canonical slot order (e.g. with `Fast` slots
  `LennardJones`, `Coulomb`, `SpmeReal`, `MorseBonded`, `HarmonicAngle`
  and `Slow` slot `SpmeReciprocal`, the LJ slot's row is 0 within
  `fast_*` and the SPME-reciprocal slot's row is 0 within `slow_*`).

- `ForceFieldError` — error type. Variants: <!-- rq-a2e20b02 -->
  - `Gpu(GpuError)` — CUDA driver / kernel-launch failure from any
    slot's kernel or the combiner.
  - `Timings(TimingsError)` — CUDA event recording failure.
  - `NeighborList(NeighborListError)` — surfaces failures from the
    cell-list pipeline (see `neighbor-list.md`), including the
    `NeighborListOverflow` and `BoxTooSmallForCells` cases.
  - `DuplicateLabel(&'static str)` — two slots constructed with the
    same `label()`. Reported from `ForceField::new`.

- `PotentialBuildContext<'a>` — bundle of borrowed references to every <!-- rq-d116af5f -->
  parsed-config and topology input a built-in `PotentialBuilder` might
  read. Built once by `ForceField::new` and passed by reference to each
  builder's `build(cx)` call. Fields:

  ```rust
  pub struct PotentialBuildContext<'a> {
      pub gpu: &'a GpuContext,
      pub particle_count: usize,
      pub sim_box: &'a SimulationBox,
      pub particle_types: &'a [ParticleTypeConfig],
      pub pair_interactions: &'a [PairInteractionConfig],
      pub bond_types: &'a [BondTypeConfig],
      pub angle_types: &'a [AngleTypeConfig],
      pub coulomb_config: Option<&'a CoulombConfig>,
      pub spme_config: Option<&'a SpmeConfig>,
      pub charges: &'a [f32],
      pub bond_list: &'a BondList,
      pub angle_list: &'a AngleList,
      pub exclusion_list: &'a ExclusionList,
      pub neighbor_list_config: &'a NeighborListConfig,
  }
  ```

  Each builder reads only the fields it needs. The context is distinct
  from `ForceFieldContext`, which is the per-step context handed to
  `Potential::compute`.

- `PotentialBuilder` — object-safe trait implemented by every potential's <!-- rq-e8550f96 -->
  factory. Each builder is responsible for one slot.

  ```rust
  pub trait PotentialBuilder: std::fmt::Debug + Send + Sync {
      fn build(
          &self,
          cx: &PotentialBuildContext<'_>,
      ) -> Result<Option<Box<dyn Potential>>, ForceFieldError>;
  }
  ```

  - `build` inspects `cx` and returns `Ok(Some(slot))` if this builder's
    activation condition (see *Slots*) is satisfied, or `Ok(None)` if
    not. `Err` is reserved for genuine construction failures (GPU
    allocation, malformed inputs that survived config validation, etc.).
  - Two distinct builders may not produce slots with the same
    `Potential::label()`. The framework enforces this in
    `ForceField::new`; builders themselves do not need to check.

- `PotentialRegistry` — open-extensible registry of `PotentialBuilder`s. <!-- rq-50f0a96a -->
  The registry's iteration order is the slot evaluation order. Fields:

  ```rust
  pub struct PotentialRegistry {
      pub builders: Vec<Box<dyn PotentialBuilder>>,
  }
  ```

  Methods:
  - `PotentialRegistry::new() -> Self` — constructs an empty registry.
  - `PotentialRegistry::with_builtins() -> Self` — constructs a registry
    pre-populated with the six built-in `PotentialBuilder`s in the
    canonical evaluation order: `LennardJonesBuilder`, `CoulombBuilder`,
    `SpmeRealBuilder`, `SpmeReciprocalBuilder`, `MorseBondedBuilder`,
    `HarmonicAngleBuilder`.
  - `register(&mut self, builder: Box<dyn PotentialBuilder>)` — appends
    a builder to the end of the registry. `ForceField::new` calls this
    indirectly via `heddle_md::Registries::register_potential` when the
    caller assembles a custom bundle, or directly via
    `PotentialRegistry::register` for one-registry-at-a-time
    composition.

  `PotentialRegistry` is also reachable as the `potentials` field of
  the runner-level `heddle_md::Registries` bundle (see
  `simulation-runner.md`). The runner's
  `run_simulation_with_registries` entry point reads the bundle's
  `potentials` field instead of constructing
  `PotentialRegistry::with_builtins()` internally, so custom
  potential builders flow through the same path as built-ins.

### Functions and methods <!-- rq-17abcb76 -->

- `ForceField::new(registry: &PotentialRegistry, gpu: &GpuContext, particle_count: usize, sim_box: &SimulationBox, particle_types: &[ParticleTypeConfig], pair_interactions: &[PairInteractionConfig], bond_types: &[BondTypeConfig], angle_types: &[AngleTypeConfig], coulomb_config: Option<&CoulombConfig>, spme_config: Option<&SpmeConfig>, charges: &[f32], bond_list: &BondList, angle_list: &AngleList, exclusion_list: &ExclusionList, neighbor_list_config: &NeighborListConfig) -> Result<ForceField, ForceFieldError>` <!-- rq-79938dbf -->
  - Builds a `PotentialBuildContext` populated from every parameter
    listed above (apart from `registry`).
  - Iterates `registry.builders` in registration order. For each builder,
    calls `builder.build(&cx)`. When the call returns `Ok(Some(slot))`,
    appends the slot to the `ForceField`'s slot list. `Ok(None)` is the
    no-op skip path (this builder's activation condition was not met).
    Any `Err(_)` short-circuits and is returned unchanged.
  - When no builder produces a slot, returns a `ForceField` with
    `slots.len() == 0`.
  - Allocates the five flat slot-output buffers (`slot_forces_x/y/z`,
    `slot_energies`, `slot_virials`) of length
    `slots.len() * particle_count` on `gpu.device`. When either factor
    is zero, the allocations are length-zero.
  - Builds the shared `NeighborListState`:
    - Computes `r_cut = max(slot.max_cutoff() for slot in slots if
      slot.max_cutoff().is_some())`. If no slot reports a cutoff,
      `neighbor_list` is set to `None` and the framework launches no
      neighbor-list kernels for the lifetime of the run.
    - Otherwise consults `neighbor_list_config`:
      - `CellList { max_neighbors, r_skin }`: calls
        `NeighborListState::new_cell_list(gpu, sim_box,
        particle_count, r_cut, max_neighbors, r_skin as f32)`. May
        return `ForceFieldError::NeighborList(_)` (e.g.
        `BoxTooSmallForCells`).
      - `AllPairs`: calls `NeighborListState::new_trivial(gpu,
        sim_box, particle_count)`.
  - Returns `ForceFieldError::DuplicateLabel(_)` if two slots end up
    with the same `label()`.

- `ForceField::step(&mut self, buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers, sim_box: &SimulationBox, timings: &mut Timings, level: AggregateLevel) -> Result<(), ForceFieldError>` <!-- rq-3579df3b -->
  - Evaluates every slot regardless of class. Equivalent to invoking
    `step_class` once for each class present, except that the
    neighbor-list update and combiner each run exactly once.
  - When `self.neighbor_list` is `Some(nl)`, calls `nl.pre_step(sim_box,
    buffers, timings)` to run the generation-cache check, the
    displacement check, and the rebuild as needed. When `None`, this
    step is skipped.
  - Constructs a `ForceFieldContext { neighbor_list:
    self.neighbor_list.as_ref() }` valid for the duration of the
    compute phase.
  - For each slot in `self.slots`, in canonical slot order, calls
    `slot.compute(buffers, sim_box, view, &cx, timings, level)`, where
    `view` is a `SlotOutputView` whose five fields point into the row
    `class_local_index * particle_count .. (class_local_index + 1) *
    particle_count` of the slot's class's flat slot-output buffers.
    The slot writes into the force-component fields of `view` on every
    call and into the energy and virial fields only when
    `level == AggregateLevel::ForcesAndScalars`.
  - Launches `accumulate_forces` once (with
    `KernelStage::AccumulateForces`). The combiner runs regardless of
    `level`. When the slot list is empty across every class,
    `accumulate_forces` still launches and writes zeros to
    `buffers.forces_*`, `buffers.potential_energies`, and
    `buffers.virials`. When `level == AggregateLevel::ForcesOnly`,
    `buffers.potential_energies` and `buffers.virials` aggregate
    whatever slot-output values the most recent `ForcesAndScalars`
    call wrote — they are *not* refreshed by a `ForcesOnly` call. The
    caller is responsible for issuing a `ForcesAndScalars` call before
    reading those fields (see *Force Evaluation Pipeline* above).
  - Returns `Ok(())` on success.
  - Empty-state contract per *Empty State* above.

- `ForceField::step_class(&mut self, class: ForceClass, buffers: &mut ParticleBuffers, sim_box: &SimulationBox, timings: &mut Timings, level: AggregateLevel) -> Result<(), ForceFieldError>` <!-- rq-be1eb548 -->
  - Re-evaluates only slots whose `frequency_class() == class`.
  - When the framework contains no slots of `class`, returns `Ok(())`
    immediately, launching no kernels and leaving
    `ParticleBuffers.forces_*` untouched (no-op semantics; see
    *Empty State*).
  - Otherwise, performs the same neighbor-list-update / compute /
    combiner sequence as `step`, but restricted to slots in `class`,
    and propagates `level` to each selected slot's `compute` call with
    the same semantics as `step` above. The combiner still reads every
    class's slot-output buffers (not just `class`'s) so that
    `ParticleBuffers.forces_*` reflects the most recent total across
    both classes.
  - Returns `Ok(())` when `particle_count == 0`, launching no kernels.

### Combiner Kernel <!-- rq-c0f98145 -->

`kernels/forces.cu` declares one `extern "C"` kernel:

```c
extern "C" __global__ void accumulate_forces(
    const float *fast_slot_forces_x,   // shape [num_fast_slots * n]
    const float *fast_slot_forces_y,
    const float *fast_slot_forces_z,
    const float *fast_slot_energies,
    const float *fast_slot_virials,
    unsigned int num_fast_slots,
    const float *slow_slot_forces_x,   // shape [num_slow_slots * n]
    const float *slow_slot_forces_y,
    const float *slow_slot_forces_z,
    const float *slow_slot_energies,
    const float *slow_slot_virials,
    unsigned int num_slow_slots,
    float *forces_x,
    float *forces_y,
    float *forces_z,
    float *potential_energies,
    float *virials,
    unsigned int n);
```

Each thread maps to one particle index
`i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x` (block size 256, grid
`ceil(n / 256)`, no shared memory, default stream of
`particle_buffers.device`). The thread computes, for each output quantity
`Q` in `{forces_x, forces_y, forces_z, potential_energies, virials}`:

```text
sum_Q = 0
for k in 0..num_fast_slots:
    sum_Q += fast_slot_Q[k * n + i]
for k in 0..num_slow_slots:
    sum_Q += slow_slot_Q[k * n + i]
Q[i] = sum_Q
```

The sums are performed left-to-right with classes ordered Fast then
Slow, and within each class in registration order; the order is fixed
across runs so identical inputs yield byte-identical outputs.

When `num_fast_slots + num_slow_slots == 0`, neither loop executes and
the five output slices are set to zero at index `i`. When one class
has zero slots, only the other class's loop contributes.

The kernel does not branch on slot identity and does not read pointers
beyond each class's `[num_{class}_slots * n - 1]`. Adding a new slot
in either class does not change the kernel's signature.

## Determinism Guarantees <!-- rq-76cb9922 -->

- The combiner and every slot's `compute` launches run on the default
  stream of the same `Arc<CudaDevice>` carried by `ParticleBuffers`.
  CUDA's implicit per-stream ordering guarantees that any buffer
  written by a slot's `compute` is visible to subsequent default-stream
  launches without explicit synchronisation, and that the combiner —
  which reads only the slot-output buffers — sees a consistent state.
  A slot that introduces a secondary CUDA stream must guarantee that,
  by the time its `compute` returns, every device buffer it has written
  is visible to subsequent default-stream launches, and that every
  device buffer it reads has been written by a preceding default-stream
  launch the slot waited on. No in-tree slot uses a secondary stream.
- The slot order produced by `ForceField::new` is deterministic and
  identical across runs with the same config.
- Each slot writes into its assigned row of its class's flat
  slot-output buffers; rows are disjoint and written by exactly one
  slot.
- The combiner's summation orders classes Fast-then-Slow and orders
  slots within each class by registration. The order is fixed across
  runs, so per-atom force, potential-energy, and virial values are
  byte-reproducible.
- Two runs that issue the same sequence of `step` / `step_class` calls
  with the same arguments produce byte-identical
  `ParticleBuffers.forces_*`, `potential_energies`, and `virials` at
  every step. The class system does not introduce non-determinism;
  RESPA's staleness of Slow contributions between Slow-class
  evaluations is deterministic.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-e448909a -->

- A user-supplied DSL for custom potentials. Implementing `Potential`
  is a Rust source-code change; potentials are not loaded from
  configuration or shared libraries.
- Concrete RESPA-style integrators. The framework exposes the
  per-class evaluation surface that a RESPA integrator would consume,
  but no in-tree integrator splits its plan by `ForceClass` today.
- A per-class read API on `ForceField` (e.g. `class_force_view(class)`)
  that lets an integrator kick by class-only force. RESPA integrators
  that need this land alongside their own dedicated read API; v1 of
  the class system only decomposes evaluation and aggregates back into
  the single `ParticleBuffers.forces_*` total.
- A third force class beyond `Fast` and `Slow` (e.g. for RESPA-3).
  Adding a variant is a deliberate API change rather than an
  open-extension point.
- Per-slot streams or async overlap of contribution and reduction
  kernels.
- Mid-run reconfiguration of slot membership. The slot list is fixed
  at `ForceField::new` and never modified.
- Slot ordering being user-configurable. The order is fixed in
  `ForceField::new`.
- Wiring the per-particle `potential_energies` and `virials` aggregates
  into log output, trajectory output, or pressure-coupling barostats.
  The framework produces the per-particle aggregates each step; the
  consumers of those aggregates (log writer, pressure logger, NPT
  barostat) are documented in their own files.
- Full virial-tensor accumulation. The framework's per-pair virial is
  the scalar trace `r_ij · F_ij`; per-component virial accumulation
  (xx, yy, zz, xy, xz, yz) is not in scope.

    Given a runner walking a StepPlan containing SubStep::ForceEval { class: None }
    When the runner reaches the ForceEval sub-step
    Then force_field.step(...) is invoked (every slot's kernels fire)

  @rq-256287cb
  Scenario: SubStep::ForceEval { class: Some(Fast) } dispatches to step_class(Fast)
    Given a runner walking a StepPlan containing
      SubStep::ForceEval { class: Some(ForceClass::Fast) }
    When the runner reaches the ForceEval sub-step
    Then force_field.step_class(ForceClass::Fast, ...) is invoked
    And  no Slow slot's compute kernels fire during this sub-step

  # --- Reproducibility ---

  @rq-c8e5b14e
  Scenario: Two independent runs with identical inputs are byte-identical
    Given two independently-constructed ForceFields with identical parameters
    And two ParticleBuffers built from byte-identical ParticleStates of N=64
    When force_field.step(...) is called on each
    And the two ParticleBuffers are downloaded
    Then run A's forces_x, forces_y, forces_z agree byte-for-byte with run B's

  # --- Combiner correctness ---

  @rq-a5aa743e
  Scenario: Combiner sums slot rows in slot order
    Given a ForceField with two slots whose slot_forces_x rows are
      row 0 = [1.0, 2.0] and row 1 = [10.0, 20.0]
    When the combiner runs with num_slots = 2 and n = 2
    Then forces_x equals [11.0, 22.0]

  @rq-3e9217e2
  Scenario: Combiner with num_slots == 0 writes zeros
    Given a ForceField with zero slots and particle_count == 4
    When the combiner runs with num_slots = 0 and n = 4
    Then forces_x, forces_y, forces_z are all zero

  @rq-82acb52f
  Scenario: Combiner is a single-threaded write per output element
    Given a ForceField with two slots whose slot_forces_* rows are known
    When force_field.step(...) is called twice on identical inputs
    Then the resulting forces_* agree byte-for-byte across the two calls

  # --- Shared neighbor list ---

  @rq-b33cf896
  Scenario: ForceField with a short-range potential owns a shared neighbor list
    Given a ForceField with one LennardJones slot in CellList mode
    When ForceField::new completes
    Then ForceField::neighbor_list is Some(_)
    And the shared NeighborListState's max_neighbors equals the config value

  @rq-433c972f
  Scenario: ForceField with only a bonded potential owns no neighbor list
    Given a ForceField with one MorseBonded slot (and no pair_interactions)
    When ForceField::new completes
    Then ForceField::neighbor_list is None

  @rq-81e84c73
  Scenario: ForceFieldContext exposes the shared neighbor list to compute
    Given a ForceField with a LennardJones slot in any mode
    And a stub Potential whose compute() records the value of cx.neighbor_list
    When ForceField::step is called
    Then the stub records `Some(_)` (the same NeighborListState reference the LJ slot uses)

  @rq-e39d0ed8
  Scenario: max_cutoff aggregation determines the neighbor-list radius
    Given two short-range Potential implementations reporting max_cutoff() = Some(2.0) and Some(5.0)
    And NeighborListConfig::CellList { max_neighbors, r_skin }
    When ForceField::new constructs the shared neighbor list
    Then the neighbor list's r_search equals 5.0 + r_skin

  @rq-47540d14
  Scenario: A bonded-only ForceField step launches no neighbor-list kernels
    Given a ForceField whose only slot returns max_cutoff() = None
    When ForceField::step is called
    Then timings reports zero samples for KernelStage::NeighborDisplacementSquared
    And timings reports zero samples for KernelStage::NeighborListBuild

  # --- Per-particle energy and virial outputs ---

  @rq-531faea9
  Scenario: ForceField with N=4 LJ-only step populates potential_energies and virials
    Given a constructed ForceField with one LennardJones slot and N=4
    And a ParticleState placed so the LJ contributions are non-zero
    When ForceField::step is called
    And ParticleBuffers is downloaded
    Then potential_energies is finite and non-zero in the expected pattern
    And virials is finite and non-zero in the expected pattern

  @rq-a85e8216
  Scenario: Slot-output buffers have five flat arrays sized num_slots * N
    Given a ForceField with two slots and particle_count = 8
    Then ForceField::slot_forces_x, slot_forces_y, slot_forces_z,
      slot_energies, and slot_virials each have length 16

  @rq-3d38868e
  Scenario: Combiner sums slot energies and virials in slot order
    Given a ForceField with two slots whose slot_energies rows are
      row 0 = [1.0, 2.0] and row 1 = [10.0, 20.0]
    And whose slot_virials rows are row 0 = [0.5, 1.0] and row 1 = [5.0, 10.0]
    When the combiner runs with num_slots = 2 and n = 2
    Then particle_buffers.potential_energies equals [11.0, 22.0]
    And particle_buffers.virials equals [5.5, 11.0]

  @rq-c0f2daca
  Scenario: Zero-slot step writes zeros to potential_energies and virials
    Given a constructed ForceField with force_field.slots.is_empty()
    And a ParticleBuffers with particle_count() == 4 and arbitrary prior contents in
      potential_energies and virials
    When ForceField::step is called
    And ParticleBuffers is downloaded
    Then potential_energies and virials are each [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

  @rq-db3b3d5e
  Scenario: System total potential energy equals sum of particle shares
    Given a constructed ForceField with one LennardJones slot and N atoms
    When ForceField::step is called
    And the per-particle potential_energies are downloaded
    Then their sum equals the expected total LJ energy of the configuration within f32 round-off

  @rq-7fe57a77
  Scenario: System total scalar virial equals sum of particle shares
    Given a constructed ForceField with one LennardJones slot and N atoms
    When ForceField::step is called with AggregateLevel::ForcesAndScalars
    And the per-particle virials are downloaded
    Then their sum equals Σ_{i<j within cutoff} r_ij · F_ij within f32 round-off

  # --- AggregateLevel ---

  @rq-5985846f
  Scenario: step(ForcesOnly) updates forces and leaves potential_energies / virials stale
    Given a constructed ForceField with one LennardJones slot and N atoms
    And ForceField::step has just been called with AggregateLevel::ForcesAndScalars,
      producing potential_energies = E_0 and virials = W_0 on the device
    When particle positions are changed and ForceField::step is called with
      AggregateLevel::ForcesOnly
    Then forces_x, forces_y, forces_z reflect the LJ contribution at the new positions
    And potential_energies on the device is byte-identical to E_0
    And virials on the device is byte-identical to W_0
    And per-slot LJ energy and virial slot-output rows are byte-identical to the
      rows the prior ForcesAndScalars call wrote

  @rq-beccac31
  Scenario: step(ForcesAndScalars) refreshes potential_energies and virials
    Given a constructed ForceField with one LennardJones slot and N atoms
    And ForceField::step has just been called with AggregateLevel::ForcesAndScalars
      at positions P_0, producing potential_energies = E_0 on the device
    When particle positions are changed to P_1
    And ForceField::step is called with AggregateLevel::ForcesAndScalars
    Then potential_energies on the device is the LJ potential energy share evaluated
      at P_1, differing from E_0 by the position change
    And forces_x, forces_y, forces_z reflect the LJ contribution at P_1

  @rq-55d441ee
  Scenario: Two runs with identical (call, level) sequences are byte-identical
    Given two independent ForceField instances A and B with identical configs and
      identical initial ParticleBuffers
    When each runs the same sequence of K force evaluations, each step at the same
      AggregateLevel value (a mix of ForcesOnly and ForcesAndScalars)
    Then forces_x, forces_y, forces_z, potential_energies, and virials on the
      device agree byte-for-byte between A and B

  @rq-fcc5cea5
  Scenario: A bonded-only slot writes all five quantities regardless of level
    Given a constructed ForceField with one MorseBonded slot (a bonded
      slot whose internal compute kernel is not split)
    When ForceField::step is called with AggregateLevel::ForcesOnly
    Then the MorseBonded slot-output row's energy and virial entries are written
      by the call (the slot's compute ignores level)
    And forces_x, forces_y, forces_z on the device reflect the bonded contribution

  @rq-d2bf331b
  Scenario: A pair-force slot honours ForcesOnly
    Given a constructed ForceField with one LennardJones slot
    And the LJ slot's slot-output energy and virial rows initialised to known
      nonzero patterns E_slot and W_slot
    When ForceField::step is called with AggregateLevel::ForcesOnly
    Then the LJ slot's slot-output energy and virial rows are byte-identical to
      E_slot and W_slot (the pair-force slot's compute skipped them)
    And the LJ slot's slot-output force rows are overwritten

  @rq-82822681
  Scenario: Combiner always runs regardless of level
    Given a constructed ForceField with at least one slot
    When ForceField::step is called with AggregateLevel::ForcesOnly
    Then accumulate_forces is launched exactly once
    And the timings record a single AccumulateForces stage tick for this call
