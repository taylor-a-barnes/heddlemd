# Feature: Performance Analysis and Timings Output <!-- rq-bbb62e9c -->

The simulation runner collects per-stage timing data throughout every
phase and writes one summary table per phase to a separate `.timings`
file alongside the per-phase trajectory and log. Kernel launches are
timed with CUDA events (submitted to the default stream so they do not
disturb GPU/host pipelining beyond the inherent kernel cost); host
operations are timed with `std::time::Instant` wall-clock measurements.

Timings are always collected — there is no opt-out in schema v1. The
cost is ~1 µs of overhead per CUDA event, which is negligible compared
to typical kernel runtimes.

One timings file is produced per phase that runs to completion, at the
path `config.phases[i].output.timings_path` (defaulting to
`<root>.out.<phase-name>.timings`). Each per-phase file contains the
samples accumulated during that phase only; counts and totals do not
aggregate across phases. A phase that fails mid-loop leaves no
timings file for that phase, exactly as a single-phase failure would.

Timing data never enters the trajectory or log files; those remain
bit-wise reproducible across runs on the same GPU. The `.timings`
file contents are expected to vary run-to-run because wall-clock
measurements are inherently non-deterministic.

## Instrumented Stages <!-- rq-1bd297f4 -->

The runner records samples against a fixed set of stage names. Stages with
zero samples in a given run are omitted from the output file.

### Kernel stages (CUDA-event timed) <!-- rq-312e5f8e -->

One CUDA event pair per stage. The runner (or the integrator slot acting
through the runner) records the start event immediately before each kernel
launch and the stop event immediately after. Stages:

Lennard-Jones potential slot (always present in the `ForceField`):

- `lj_pair_force` — all-pairs kernel; recorded only when
  `NeighborListConfig::AllPairs` is selected.
- `lj_pair_force_neighbor` — neighbor-list-driven kernel; recorded
  only when `NeighborListConfig::CellList` is selected.

Neighbor list (present when `NeighborListConfig::CellList` is selected;
see `forces/neighbor-list.md`):

- `neighbor_displacement_squared` — per-atom displacement² versus the
  reference positions. Launched once per timestep.
- `neighbor_list_build` — full cell-list neighbor search. Launched
  once per rebuild.
- `copy_positions_into_reference` — refresh of the reference positions
  array. Launched once per rebuild.

Morse-bonded potential slot (present when the config supplies a `bonds`
file and at least one bond exists):

- `morse_bond_force` — per-bond force kernel.
- `reduce_bond_forces` — per-atom reduction of bond contributions.

Force-field combiner (always run; sums every slot's private accumulator
into `particle_buffers.forces_*`):

- `accumulate_forces`

Velocity-Verlet integrator stages (selected by `kind = "velocity-verlet"`):

- `vv_kick_drift`
- `vv_kick`
- `vv_kick_drift_lossless`
- `vv_kick_lossless`

Langevin BAOAB integrator stages (selected by `kind = "langevin-baoab"`,
see `integration/langevin-baoab.md`):

- `langevin_kick_half` — the B step (reuses the `vv_kick` kernel
  internally; the distinct stage label distinguishes Langevin calls).
- `langevin_drift_half` — the A step (`lan_drift_half` kernel).
- `langevin_ou_step` — the O step (`lan_ou_step` kernel).

Only the stages corresponding to the chosen integrator have nonzero
counts; the others are absent from the output file. The velocity-Verlet
slot also leaves exactly one of `vv_kick_drift` / `vv_kick_drift_lossless`
and one of `vv_kick` / `vv_kick_lossless` empty, determined by the
`lossless` flag.

A kernel-launch helper that early-returns (e.g. when `particle_count == 0`)
does not record any sample. The CUDA event pair for that stage may still
exist in the runner's `Timings` instance with zero accumulated samples.

When a phase runs under CUDA graph mode (`cuda-graphs.md`), per-kernel
event records are produced only by the dry capture iteration; every
subsequent replay step contributes nothing further. Each per-kernel
`KernelStage` row in such a phase's `.timings` file therefore shows
exactly one sample regardless of `n_steps`. The per-phase
`total_runtime` row and the host stages are populated as in non-graph
mode. To obtain a full per-kernel breakdown across all steps, run with
`[simulation].cuda_graphs_disable = true`.

### Host stages (Instant-timed) <!-- rq-36105526 -->

One host timer per stage. Each is recorded as a single elapsed `Duration`
per occurrence. Stages:

- `config_load` — duration of `load_config`. Appears in **phase 0's
  timings only** (the loader runs once, before any phase begins).
- `init_load` — duration of `load_init_state`. Phase-0-only, same
  rationale.
- `gpu_init` — duration of `init_device`. Phase-0-only.
- `velocity_generation` — duration of Maxwell-Boltzmann sampling
  and momentum subtraction (zero samples when the init file supplies
  velocities; phase-0-only since velocity sampling happens once at
  startup).
- `host_to_device_upload` — duration of `ParticleBuffers::new`
  (which performs the initial bulk upload). Phase-0-only.
- `device_to_host_download` — duration of
  `ParticleState::download_from` inside the loop's snapshot/log
  download steps. One sample per call, recorded into the
  currently-running phase's Timings.
- `trajectory_write` — duration of one
  `TrajectoryWriter::write_frame` call. One sample per written
  frame, recorded into the currently-running phase's Timings.
- `log_write` — duration of one `LogWriter::write_row` call. One
  sample per written row, recorded into the currently-running
  phase's Timings.
- `neighbor_list_rebuild` — wall-clock duration of one full neighbor
  list rebuild, covering the device-to-host download of cell indices,
  the host-side stable sort, the upload of the sorted ordering, and
  the kernel launches that run inside the rebuild (sample is recorded
  by the runner around the entire rebuild block). Present only when
  `NeighborListConfig::CellList` is selected. One sample per rebuild,
  recorded into the currently-running phase's Timings.

### Synthetic stages <!-- rq-7eb22aad -->

- `total_runtime` — single-sample wall-clock measurement from the
  start of each phase's warm-up to the moment just before that
  phase's `.timings` file is serialised. One sample per phase
  (recorded into the per-phase Timings). The aggregate per-run
  wall-clock is reported on stdout by the final-summary line; no
  cross-phase aggregate appears in any timings file.

## Timing Methodology <!-- rq-fdbb902d -->

### CUDA events <!-- rq-91cec484 -->

The runner holds one `(start, stop)` event pair per kernel stage. Both events
are created with default flags on the `device` carried by the `GpuContext`
from `init_device()`.

Launch sequencing per kernel stage:

```
record start event on default stream
call kernel-launch helper
record stop event on default stream
```

The start event for the first occurrence of a stage is recorded immediately
before the helper call. The elapsed time is computed lazily:

- On the **second and subsequent** occurrences of a stage, the previous
  pair's elapsed time is queried before being reused. The query
  (`cuEventElapsedTime`) blocks until both events have completed; the
  duration is accumulated into the stage's running statistics.
- At end of run, the final outstanding pair for each stage is drained by
  querying its elapsed time and accumulating the result.

Event objects are reused across timesteps. Memory cost is constant in the
number of timesteps.

When a kernel-launch helper early-returns (empty state), the runner skips
the record/start/stop sequence entirely. The stage's event pair remains
unrecorded for that iteration; the outstanding-pair state machine treats
it as if no launch ever happened.

### Host wall-clock <!-- rq-5d1f8e8e -->

Each host stage is timed with `std::time::Instant`:

```
let started = std::time::Instant::now();
operation();
timings.record_host(stage, started.elapsed());
```

Elapsed durations are stored internally as `u128` nanoseconds and converted
to floating-point microseconds at output time.

### Sample bookkeeping <!-- rq-e16e72bd -->

For every stage, the runner maintains:

- `count: u64` — total recorded samples.
- `total_ns: u128` — sum of all sample durations in nanoseconds.
- `min_ns: u64` — minimum sample duration (max-initialised before first
  sample; remains undefined when count is 0).
- `max_ns: u64` — maximum sample duration (zero-initialised; remains
  undefined when count is 0).

CUDA event elapsed times are reported by cudarc as `f32` milliseconds.
The runner converts to nanoseconds via
`(elapsed_ms * 1_000_000.0).round() as u128` and clamps a negative-valued
result (which can occasionally appear due to NVIDIA driver noise) to `0`.

Mean is derived at output time: `mean_us = total_ns as f64 / 1000.0 / count as f64`.

## Output File Format <!-- rq-56364532 -->

The timings file is a UTF-8 text file with one header line followed by one
row per non-empty stage. Lines end with `\n`.

Column layout, fixed widths, ASCII:

| Column | Width | Alignment | Content |
| ------ | ----- | --------- | ------- |
| `stage` | 28 | left | stage name (snake_case identifier) |
| `count` | 10 | right | sample count, base-10 integer |
| `total_ms` | 14 | right | total time across all samples in milliseconds, three decimals |
| `mean_us` | 13 | right | mean time per sample in microseconds, one decimal |
| `min_us` | 11 | right | minimum sample in microseconds, one decimal |
| `max_us` | 11 | right | maximum sample in microseconds, one decimal |

Columns are separated by single spaces (one column's right edge sits one
character before the next column's left edge), so each row is exactly
`28 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 14 + 1 + 13 + 1 + 11 + 1 + 11 = 92` characters wide
followed by `\n`.

A value that does not fit in its nominal column width is written in full
(no truncation, no scientific notation) — the row simply becomes longer
than 92 characters.

### Row ordering <!-- rq-1b34278b -->

Rows appear in this fixed order, with absent stages skipped:

1. `vv_kick_drift` or `vv_kick_drift_lossless` (whichever is present)
2. `langevin_kick_half` (B step, pre and post)
3. `langevin_drift_half` (A step)
4. `langevin_ou_step` (O step)
5. `neighbor_displacement_squared`
6. `copy_positions_into_reference`
7. `neighbor_list_build`
8. `lj_pair_force` or `lj_pair_force_neighbor` (whichever is present)
10. `morse_bond_force`
11. `reduce_bond_forces`
12. `accumulate_forces`
13. `vv_kick` or `vv_kick_lossless` (whichever is present)
14. `host_to_device_upload`
15. `device_to_host_download`
16. `neighbor_list_rebuild`
17. `trajectory_write`
18. `log_write`
19. `velocity_generation`
20. `config_load`
21. `init_load`
22. `gpu_init`
23. `total_runtime`

```

### Overwrite policy <!-- rq-4cf03f96 -->

The runner refuses to start when a non-empty file already exists at the
resolved `output.timings_path`. The pre-flight check happens alongside the
trajectory and log existence checks, before the init file is read. The
actual file creation uses `OpenOptions::create_new` so the resolution is
race-free.

### Failed runs <!-- rq-b7317e2d -->

The timings file is written only when `run_simulation` succeeds. A run
that fails before the loop completes leaves no timings file at all (any
partial timings are discarded).

## Feature API <!-- rq-410afcd3 -->

### Types <!-- rq-4f5643f1 -->

- `KernelStage` — opaque newtype wrapping a `&'static str` stage name. <!-- rq-dc8a0ff7 -->
  `Copy`, `Eq`, `Hash`, `Debug`. Method
  `KernelStage::name(self) -> &'static str` returns the wrapped name.
  Stage instances are referenced via associated consts, one per timed
  kernel:
  - `KernelStage::VV_KICK_DRIFT` → `"vv_kick_drift"`
  - `KernelStage::VV_KICK` → `"vv_kick"`
  - `KernelStage::VV_KICK_DRIFT_LOSSLESS` → `"vv_kick_drift_lossless"`
  - `KernelStage::VV_KICK_LOSSLESS` → `"vv_kick_lossless"`
  - `KernelStage::LJ_PAIR_FORCE` → `"lj_pair_force"`
  - `KernelStage::LJ_PAIR_FORCE` → `"lj_pair_force"` (and per-potential analogues for Coulomb / SPME-real)
  - `KernelStage::LANGEVIN_KICK_HALF` → `"langevin_kick_half"`
  - `KernelStage::LANGEVIN_DRIFT_HALF` → `"langevin_drift_half"`
  - `KernelStage::LANGEVIN_OU_STEP` → `"langevin_ou_step"`
  - `KernelStage::MORSE_BOND_FORCE` → `"morse_bond_force"`
  - `KernelStage::REDUCE_BOND_FORCES` → `"reduce_bond_forces"`
  - `KernelStage::ACCUMULATE_FORCES` → `"accumulate_forces"`
  - `KernelStage::NEIGHBOR_DISPLACEMENT_SQUARED` → `"neighbor_displacement_squared"`
  - `KernelStage::NEIGHBOR_LIST_BUILD` → `"neighbor_list_build"`
  - `KernelStage::COPY_POSITIONS_INTO_REFERENCE` → `"copy_positions_into_reference"`
  - `KernelStage::POTENTIAL_ENERGY_REDUCE` → `"potential_energy_reduce"` —
    the runner's per-log-row launch of `virial_sum_reduce` against
    `buffers.potential_energies` (see
    `integration/nose-hoover-chain.md`'s `compute_total_potential_energy`).
    Distinct from `KernelStage::VIRIAL_SUM_REDUCE`, which counts
    barostat-driven launches of the same kernel binary.

  The associated const `KernelStage::ORDER: &'static [KernelStage]`
  is the canonical registry of known kernel stages and fixes the row
  order used by `finalize` and the output file. Adding a stage means
  declaring a new associated const and appending it to `ORDER`.

- `HostStage` — opaque newtype wrapping a `&'static str` stage name. <!-- rq-d29f2811 -->
  `Copy`, `Eq`, `Hash`, `Debug`. Method
  `HostStage::name(self) -> &'static str` returns the wrapped name.
  Stage instances are referenced via associated consts:
  - `HostStage::CONFIG_LOAD` → `"config_load"`
  - `HostStage::INIT_LOAD` → `"init_load"`
  - `HostStage::GPU_INIT` → `"gpu_init"`
  - `HostStage::VELOCITY_GENERATION` → `"velocity_generation"`
  - `HostStage::HOST_TO_DEVICE_UPLOAD` → `"host_to_device_upload"`
  - `HostStage::DEVICE_TO_HOST_DOWNLOAD` → `"device_to_host_download"`
  - `HostStage::TRAJECTORY_WRITE` → `"trajectory_write"`
  - `HostStage::LOG_WRITE` → `"log_write"`
  - `HostStage::NEIGHBOR_LIST_REBUILD` → `"neighbor_list_rebuild"`
  - `HostStage::TOTAL_RUNTIME` → `"total_runtime"`

  The associated const `HostStage::ORDER: &'static [HostStage]` is the
  canonical registry of known host stages and fixes the row order used
  by `finalize` and the output file. Adding a stage means declaring a
  new associated const and appending it to `ORDER`.

- `Timings` — host-side state for collecting samples. Carries: <!-- rq-baf03449 -->
  - one `(CudaEvent, CudaEvent)` pair for every stage in
    `KernelStage::ORDER`
  - an outstanding-stop tracker per kernel stage (set when the
    previous occurrence's stop event has not yet been queried)
  - per-stage accumulators (`count`, `total_ns`, `min_ns`, `max_ns`)
    for every stage in `KernelStage::ORDER` and `HostStage::ORDER`
  - the `Arc<CudaDevice>` used to construct the events

  The set of valid stages is fixed at `Timings::new` time from
  `KernelStage::ORDER` and `HostStage::ORDER`; passing any other
  stage value to `kernel_start`, `kernel_stop`, or `record_host`
  panics.

- `StageStats` — public, `Clone`, `Debug` snapshot for one stage. <!-- rq-0dab90aa -->
  Fields:
  - `name: String` — stage name as it appears in the file
  - `count: u64`
  - `total_ns: u128`
  - `min_ns: u64`
  - `max_ns: u64`

  Helper methods:
  - `mean_us(&self) -> f64` — returns `total_ns as f64 / 1000.0 / count as f64`; panics in debug builds when `count == 0` (callers must skip empty stages first).

- `TimingsReport` — public, `Clone`, `Debug`. Carries an ordered <!-- rq-7453115b -->
  `Vec<StageStats>` in the row order specified above; stages with
  `count == 0` are excluded.

- `TimingsError` — error type. Variants: <!-- rq-779092ca -->
  - `Gpu(GpuError)` — CUDA driver error during event creation, recording,
    or elapsed-time query.

- `TimingsWriterError` — error type. Variants: <!-- rq-ec06c8e1 -->
  - `OutputExists { path: PathBuf }` — refusing to overwrite.
  - `Io(String)` — underlying filesystem error.

### Functions and methods <!-- rq-dae150d9 -->

- `Timings::new(device: Arc<CudaDevice>) -> Result<Timings, TimingsError>` <!-- rq-8a9c44f8 -->
  - Allocates one `(start, stop)` CUDA event pair on the given device
    (default flags) for every stage in `KernelStage::ORDER`.
  - Initialises an accumulator at zero samples for every stage in
    `KernelStage::ORDER` and `HostStage::ORDER`.
  - Returns `Gpu(_)` if event creation fails.

- `Timings::kernel_start(&mut self, stage: KernelStage) -> Result<(), TimingsError>` <!-- rq-58981e16 -->
  - Panics if `stage` is not in `KernelStage::ORDER` (the registry is
    fixed at construction time).
  - If a previous launch of the same stage has an outstanding stop event
    that has not yet been drained, this call first queries that elapsed
    time (blocking until completion), accumulates it into the stage's
    statistics, and clears the outstanding flag.
  - Records a new start event on the device's default stream.

- `Timings::kernel_stop(&mut self, stage: KernelStage) -> Result<(), TimingsError>` <!-- rq-b17e6de6 -->
  - Panics if `stage` is not in `KernelStage::ORDER`.
  - Records the stop event for the most recent `kernel_start` of the
    same stage on the default stream.
  - Sets the outstanding-stop flag so the next `kernel_start` (or
    `finalize`) will drain it.

  Calls to `kernel_start` and `kernel_stop` always come in pairs in
  source order. A bare `kernel_stop` with no preceding `kernel_start`
  for that stage debug-asserts.

- `Timings::record_host(&mut self, stage: HostStage, duration: std::time::Duration)` <!-- rq-037a9326 -->
  - Panics if `stage` is not in `HostStage::ORDER`.
  - Accumulates `duration.as_nanos()` into the stage's `total_ns`,
    increments `count`, and updates `min_ns` / `max_ns`.

- `Timings::finalize(&mut self) -> Result<TimingsReport, TimingsError>` <!-- rq-c4845f90 -->
  - For every `KernelStage` with an outstanding stop event, queries its
    elapsed time, accumulates it, and clears the flag.
  - Constructs and returns the `TimingsReport` in row order, excluding
    stages with `count == 0`.

- `write_timings_file(path: &Path, report: &TimingsReport) -> Result<(), TimingsWriterError>` <!-- rq-9b85fa6c -->
  - Creates the file at `path` using
    `OpenOptions::new().write(true).create_new(true).open(path)`.
  - Refuses to overwrite an existing file (`OutputExists`).
  - Writes one header line followed by one row per stage in the order
    encoded in `report.stages`, using the fixed column widths described
    above.
  - Flushes and closes the file before returning.

## Integration with the Runner <!-- rq-dcfdb7c9 -->

`run_simulation` constructs a `Timings` at the start of the run (after
`init_device` returns) and a `started: Instant` immediately on entry. The
sequence of recorded stages within `run_simulation` is:

1. `host_to_device_upload` — single `Instant` measurement around
   `ParticleBuffers::new(...)`.
2. `velocity_generation` — `Instant` measurement around the
   `generate_velocities` call. Skipped when explicit velocities are read
   from the init file.
3. Warm-up: `kernel_start(KernelStage::LJ_PAIR_FORCE)` / launch /
   `kernel_stop(KernelStage::LJ_PAIR_FORCE)`.
4. For each timestep:
   - `kernel_start` / launch / `kernel_stop` for the active kick-drift
     variant.
   - `kernel_start` / launch / `kernel_stop` for `LJ_PAIR_FORCE` (the
     fused pair-force kernel writes per-particle output directly; there
     is no separate reduction stage).
   - `kernel_start` / launch / `kernel_stop` for the active kick variant.
   - If a snapshot/log download is happening this step:
     - `Instant` measurement around `frame.download_from(&buffers)`.
   - If a trajectory frame is being written:
     - `Instant` measurement around `write_traj_frame(...)`.
   - If a log row is being written:
     - `Instant` measurement around `writer.write_row(...)`.
5. Flush trajectory and log writers (untimed).
6. `record_host(TotalRuntime, started.elapsed())`.
7. `let report = timings.finalize()?;`
8. `write_timings_file(&config.output.timings_path, &report)?;`

`config_load`, `init_load`, and `gpu_init` are timed by the runner's
outer wrapper (i.e. the same `run_simulation_with_phase` function records
them via `Instant` around each call). The `Timings` instance does not
yet exist when `gpu_init` is being timed, so those three durations are
buffered on the stack and recorded into the `Timings` immediately after
`Timings::new` returns.

The runner does **not** time the `.timings` file write itself; the
`total_runtime` row is captured before serialisation, and the cost of
writing the timings file is excluded from every row.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-1434abd2 -->

- Per-timestep time-series output. The output file aggregates over the
  whole run.
- A `[profiling]` configuration section. Timings collection is always on
  and has no per-feature toggles in schema v1.
- Standard deviation, percentiles, or histograms.
- GPU memory usage / occupancy / SM utilisation. Only kernel wall time is
  measured.
- Per-block or per-thread profiling. Per-kernel-launch is the smallest
  unit.
- Comparison against a previous run (regression detection). The file is a
  point-in-time snapshot.
- Cross-host or cross-GPU timing comparisons. Timings vary by hardware.
- Reproducibility of timing data; only the *trajectory* and *log* outputs
  are bit-reproducible across runs.
- A public API for external-crate stage registration. The
  `KernelStage::ORDER` and `HostStage::ORDER` arrays are the canonical
  registry; the set of valid stages is fixed at compile time, and adding
  a stage requires editing those arrays in this crate.
- Streaming the timings file to stdout. Output is to a file only.
- Compressed (gzip, etc.) timings files.
- Profile data formats for external tools (Tracy, Perfetto, Chrome
  trace). The output is plain text only.
- Concurrent / multi-stream profiling. The default stream is the only
  one in use.
