# Feature: Pair Buffer and Deterministic Segmented Reduction <!-- rq-a406a35b -->

The simulation accumulates per-pair contributions to force, potential
energy, and the scalar virial into a fixed-shape device buffer and reduces
that buffer to per-particle aggregates in a deterministic order. This file
specifies the device data structure (`PairBuffer`), the CUDA kernel that
performs the reduction (`kernels/reduce.cu`), and the Rust launch helper
that drives it.

The reduction is the keystone of the project's bit-wise reproducibility
claim: every floating-point sum is performed on the same inputs in the same
order on every run, regardless of GPU thread scheduling.

## Data Layout <!-- rq-e435f271 -->

The pair buffer is a 2D array of shape `[particle_count, max_neighbors]`
for each per-pair quantity, stored row-major with row stride
`max_neighbors`:

```
pair_forces_x:  CudaSlice<f32>  (length = particle_count * max_neighbors)
pair_forces_y:  CudaSlice<f32>  (length = particle_count * max_neighbors)
pair_forces_z:  CudaSlice<f32>  (length = particle_count * max_neighbors)
pair_energies:  CudaSlice<f32>  (length = particle_count * max_neighbors)
pair_virials:   CudaSlice<f32>  (length = particle_count * max_neighbors)
```

Slot `i * max_neighbors + k` holds the contribution to particle `i` from
its `k`-th neighbor. The slot is written by exactly one thread of the
upstream pair-force kernel; no atomics are involved at any layer.

`pair_forces_*[slot]` carries the Cartesian force on particle `i` due to
the partner `j` of slot `k`. By Newton's third law the (i, j) and (j, i)
force slots hold opposite signs.

`pair_energies[slot]` carries particle `i`'s share of the pair potential
energy `u_ij`. The contribution kernel writes `u_ij / 2` so that summing
slot (i, j) plus slot (j, i) recovers `u_ij` exactly once per pair.

`pair_virials[slot]` carries particle `i`'s share of the scalar virial
`r_ij · F_ij`. The contribution kernel writes `(r_ij · F_ij) / 2` so that
summing slot (i, j) plus slot (j, i) recovers the per-pair virial exactly
once per pair.

A separate `CudaSlice<u32>` of length `particle_count`, named
`neighbor_counts`, records the number of populated slots in each row. It is
owned by the shared `NeighborListState` (see `forces/neighbor-list.md`).
Tests allocate a synthetic counts buffer when exercising the reduction in
isolation.

`max_neighbors` and `particle_count` are fixed at `PairBuffer` construction.

## Reduction Algorithm <!-- rq-b0913965 -->

Each particle `i` is reduced by one CUDA block of `BLOCK_SIZE = 256`
threads. Two kernels share the same block-per-particle algorithm and
the same fixed-shape reduction tree but operate on disjoint subsets of
the pair-buffer fields:

- `reduce_pair_forces` reduces the three force components (`pair_forces_x`,
  `pair_forces_y`, `pair_forces_z`) into the per-particle net-force
  output buffers. Launched every timestep.
- `reduce_pair_energy_virial` reduces the two scalar quantities
  (`pair_energies`, `pair_virials`) into the per-particle energy-share
  and virial-share output buffers. Launched only when the requesting
  framework call has `AggregateLevel::ForcesAndScalars` (see
  `forces/framework.md`); on `AggregateLevel::ForcesOnly` calls it is
  not launched at all.

The algorithm is identical for every reduced quantity; the description
below uses a single quantity `q` standing for any of `pair_forces_x`,
`pair_forces_y`, `pair_forces_z`, `pair_energies`, `pair_virials`. The
kernel that reduces forces issues three independent register accumulators
through the same tree; the kernel that reduces energy and virial issues
two.

```text
count = neighbor_counts[i]
// Phase 1: strided sweep across the populated portion of the row.
// Every thread accumulates a register-resident partial sum p_t.
SWEEPS = (count + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) / BLOCK_SIZE
p_t = 0.0f
for s = 0 .. SWEEPS:
    k = s * BLOCK_SIZE + threadIdx.x
    v = (k < count) ? q[i * max_neighbors + k] : 0.0f
    p_t = p_t + v
// Phase 2: warp-level pairwise tree reduction.
// Inside each 32-lane warp, the partial sums are combined by
// pairwise butterfly shuffles in log2(32) = 5 steps:
for stride in [16, 8, 4, 2, 1]:
    p_t = p_t + __shfl_xor_sync(0xffffffff, p_t, stride)
// Phase 3: inter-warp reduction.
// Lane 0 of each warp writes its warp total to a shared-memory array
// warp_q[warp_id]. After __syncthreads(), the first warp pulls its
// eight per-warp partials back into registers (lanes >= NUM_WARPS
// read 0.0f) and runs the same pairwise butterfly tree across them.
// Thread (warp 0, lane 0) writes the block total.
```

`BLOCK_SIZE = 256` and `NUM_WARPS = BLOCK_SIZE / 32 = 8` are kernel
compile-time constants.

The Phase 1 sweep loop runs `(count + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) / BLOCK_SIZE`
sweeps, scaling with the populated row width rather than
`max_neighbors`. For `count == 0` the loop runs zero sweeps. Within
the final partial sweep, lanes whose `k >= count` contribute `0.0f`
to their partial sum and do not issue a load; lanes in any earlier
full sweep load and add a single slot value. The kernel relies on the
contract `count <= max_neighbors` (see `forces/neighbor-list.md`) for
its in-row bound — no separate `k < max_neighbors` guard is needed
because the active mask `k < count` already covers it.

Phase 2 and Phase 3 always execute their fixed warp- and inter-warp
reduction trees regardless of `count`, so the reduction tree shape
applied to the partial sums held by every block's 256 lanes is
identical across every particle in a launch.

The reduction is run-to-run bit-exact: every floating-point addition in
Phases 1–3 takes the same operands in the same order on every launch, on
the same GPU. Two runs of `reduce_pair_forces` with identical inputs
produce byte-identical output buffers.

The sum is **not** the sequential left-to-right sum
`((q[0] + q[1]) + q[2]) + ...`; it is the deterministic block tree-sum
defined above. The two values agree to within a small relative tolerance
governed by IEEE-754 round-off but generally differ in the low bits of
the f32 mantissa. The architecture explicitly permits this in
`docs/architecture.md` ("a fixed tree reduction with a deterministic
topology … as long as the tree shape depends only on the neighbor
count").

When `count == 0`, every thread's `p_t` stays at `0.0f` through Phase 1,
and the warp- and inter-warp trees propagate zero, so the five output
slices receive `0.0_f32` at index `i`.

The final writes overwrite whatever was previously in the five output
slices — the reduction does not accumulate.

## Device-side Pair-Force Frame Helper <!-- rq-73c4d574 -->

Every pair-force kernel writes into the pair buffer through a small
shared device-side helper, declared in `kernels/pair_frame.cuh` and
included by `kernels/pair_force.cu`, `kernels/coulomb.cu`, and
`kernels/spme_real.cu`. The helper centralises the universal pair-buffer
write protocol — thread→slot mapping, the three skip-the-pair guards,
the displacement and minimum-image reduction, the exclusion-scale apply,
and the per-pair `* 0.5f` halving — so each pair-force kernel reduces
to (1) a setup call, (2) the per-potential cutoff test and pair
functional form, and (3) a write call. The header declares no kernels of
its own; `init_device()` performs no `load_ptx` call for it.

The helper has three `__device__` entry points:

```c
struct PairFrame {
    bool active;
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int j;
    unsigned int slot;
    float dx;
    float dy;
    float dz;
    float r2;
};

__device__ static inline PairFrame pair_frame_setup(
    unsigned int n,
    unsigned int max_neighbors,
    const float *positions_x,
    const float *positions_y,
    const float *positions_z,
    const unsigned int *neighbor_list,
    const unsigned int *neighbor_counts,
    float lx, float ly, float lz,
    float xy, float xz, float yz,
    float *pair_forces_x,
    float *pair_forces_y,
    float *pair_forces_z,
    float *pair_energies,
    float *pair_virials);

__device__ static inline void pair_frame_write_zero(
    unsigned int slot,
    float *pair_forces_x,
    float *pair_forces_y,
    float *pair_forces_z,
    float *pair_energies,
    float *pair_virials);

__device__ static inline void pair_frame_write(
    unsigned int slot,
    float fx, float fy, float fz,
    float energy,
    float virial,
    float scale,
    float *pair_forces_x,
    float *pair_forces_y,
    float *pair_forces_z,
    float *pair_energies,
    float *pair_virials);
```

`pair_frame_setup` performs the steps a pair-force kernel needs before
the per-potential math runs:

1. Computes the thread indices
   `i = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y` and
   `k = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x`. If `i >= n` or
   `k >= max_neighbors`, returns a `PairFrame` with `active == false`
   and performs no buffer writes. The thread has no assigned slot in
   this case.
2. Computes `slot = i * max_neighbors + k`.
3. If `k >= neighbor_counts[i]`, writes `0.0_f32` to all five pair-buffer
   slots at index `slot` and returns a `PairFrame` with `active == false`
   and `slot` populated.
4. Reads `j = neighbor_list[slot]`. If `i == j` (the trivial-mode
   self-pair), writes `0.0_f32` to all five pair-buffer slots and
   returns a `PairFrame` with `active == false` and `slot` populated.
5. Computes the displacement `dx = positions_x[i] - positions_x[j]` and
   similarly `dy`, `dz`. Applies the triclinic minimum-image convention
   using the six lattice parameters `(lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz)` defined
   in `simulation-box.md`.
6. Computes `r2 = dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz`.
7. Returns a `PairFrame` with `active == true`, the populated `i`, `j`,
   `slot`, `dx`, `dy`, `dz`, and `r2`. The cutoff test itself is the
   caller's responsibility: the cutoff value differs per pair potential
   (per-pair-type table for Lennard-Jones, a single global scalar for
   the Coulomb and SPME real-space slots), so the helper does not
   attempt to share it.

`pair_frame_write_zero(slot, ...)` writes `0.0_f32` to
`pair_forces_x[slot]`, `pair_forces_y[slot]`, `pair_forces_z[slot]`,
`pair_energies[slot]`, and `pair_virials[slot]`. The caller invokes it
on the cutoff-exceeded branch (after `pair_frame_setup` returned
`active == true` but the kernel's per-potential cutoff test failed).

`pair_frame_write(slot, fx, fy, fz, energy, virial, scale, ...)`
multiplies all five inputs by `scale`, multiplies `energy` and `virial`
by an additional `0.5f`, and writes the results into the five pair-buffer
slots at index `slot`. The caller computes `fx = factor * dx`,
`fy = factor * dy`, `fz = factor * dz`, and the scalar virial
`virial = fx * dx + fy * dy + fz * dz` before invoking write; the
exclusion scale comes from `exclusion_scale(...)` declared in
`kernels/exclusions.cuh` (see `forces/topology.md`). The `0.5f` factor
is what distributes each pair's energy and virial across its two slots
`(i, j)` and `(j, i)` so the segmented reduction counts each pair
exactly once when summed over all particles.

A typical pair-force kernel using the frame is structured as:

```c
extern "C" __global__ void some_pair_force(
    const float *positions_x, const float *positions_y, const float *positions_z,
    /* per-potential parameter arrays */,
    float *pair_forces_x, float *pair_forces_y, float *pair_forces_z,
    float *pair_energies, float *pair_virials,
    unsigned int max_neighbors,
    float lx, float ly, float lz, float xy, float xz, float yz,
    /* per-potential cutoff inputs and exclusion arrays */,
    const unsigned int *neighbor_list,
    const unsigned int *neighbor_counts,
    unsigned int n)
{
    PairFrame f = pair_frame_setup(
        n, max_neighbors,
        positions_x, positions_y, positions_z,
        neighbor_list, neighbor_counts,
        lx, ly, lz, xy, xz, yz,
        pair_forces_x, pair_forces_y, pair_forces_z,
        pair_energies, pair_virials);
    if (!f.active) {
        return;
    }
    /* Per-potential cutoff lookup + test. */
    float cutoff = /* per-potential */;
    if (f.r2 > cutoff * cutoff) {
        pair_frame_write_zero(
            f.slot,
            pair_forces_x, pair_forces_y, pair_forces_z,
            pair_energies, pair_virials);
        return;
    }
    /* Per-potential pair functional: produces `factor` and `energy`. */
    float factor = /* per-potential */;
    float energy = /* per-potential */;
    /* Optional: per-potential switching function adjusts (factor, energy). */
    float fx = factor * f.dx;
    float fy = factor * f.dy;
    float fz = factor * f.dz;
    float virial = fx * f.dx + fy * f.dy + fz * f.dz;
    float scale = exclusion_scale(
        f.i, f.j, atom_excl_offsets, atom_excl_partners, /* lj_scales | coul_scales */);
    pair_frame_write(
        f.slot, fx, fy, fz, energy, virial, scale,
        pair_forces_x, pair_forces_y, pair_forces_z,
        pair_energies, pair_virials);
}
```

Adding a new pair potential (Buckingham, tabulated, ...) consists of
writing a new `extern "C"` kernel that follows this shape and supplies
its own cutoff source, pair functional form, switching policy, and
exclusion-scale array. The frame holds the universal protocol invariant
across every such addition.

### Determinism <!-- rq-d8a08c4a -->

Each pair-buffer slot is written by exactly one thread, whether through
`pair_frame_setup`'s skip-write path, the caller's
`pair_frame_write_zero` call, or `pair_frame_write`. There are no
atomics. The arithmetic inside `pair_frame_setup` (displacement,
minimum-image, `r2`) and inside `pair_frame_write` (scale apply, halving)
is performed in the documented order on identical inputs on every run.
Two runs of any kernel that uses the frame, with identical inputs and on
the same GPU, produce byte-identical pair-buffer contents.

### Empty state <!-- rq-efc6f7f7 -->

When `n == 0` or `max_neighbors == 0`, every thread's index check in
step 1 returns `active == false` and the kernel returns without
launching any per-slot writes. The pair-buffer slices that are length
zero in this case receive no writes.

## Feature API <!-- rq-c7420b98 -->

### Types <!-- rq-9197d752 -->

- `PairBuffer` — host-side wrapper around the five device per-pair <!-- rq-a0c0992f -->
  contribution buffers (three force components, energy, and scalar
  virial). All five `CudaSlice<f32>` fields are `pub` so contribution
  kernels can write into them at deterministic offsets. Also carries an
  `Arc<CudaDevice>` for allocation bookkeeping.

  Fields:
  - `device: Arc<CudaDevice>`
  - `pair_forces_x: CudaSlice<f32>`
  - `pair_forces_y: CudaSlice<f32>`
  - `pair_forces_z: CudaSlice<f32>`
  - `pair_energies: CudaSlice<f32>`
  - `pair_virials: CudaSlice<f32>`
  - private `particle_count: usize`
  - private `max_neighbors: u32`

### CUDA Kernels <!-- rq-31bd2eee -->

`kernels/reduce.cu` declares two `extern "C"` kernels that share the
same block-per-particle reduction topology:

```c
extern "C" __global__ void reduce_pair_forces(
    const float *pair_forces_x,
    const float *pair_forces_y,
    const float *pair_forces_z,
    const unsigned int *neighbor_counts,
    unsigned int max_neighbors,
    float *net_forces_x,
    float *net_forces_y,
    float *net_forces_z,
    unsigned int n);

extern "C" __global__ void reduce_pair_energy_virial(
    const float *pair_energies,
    const float *pair_virials,
    const unsigned int *neighbor_counts,
    unsigned int max_neighbors,
    float *net_energy,
    float *net_virial,
    unsigned int n);
```

Each block reduces one particle: `i = blockIdx.x`. If `i >= n` every
thread in the block returns without touching any buffer. Otherwise, the
block's 256 threads cooperatively execute the reduction algorithm above
for particle `i` — three accumulators in `reduce_pair_forces`, two in
`reduce_pair_energy_virial`.

Phase-3 inter-warp partial sums are exchanged through a static
shared-memory buffer declared inside each kernel as
`__shared__ float warp_partials[NUM_WARPS][K]` where `K = 3` for
`reduce_pair_forces` and `K = 2` for `reduce_pair_energy_virial`
(`NUM_WARPS = 8`). Neither kernel declares dynamic shared memory.

Each kernel reads only the pair-contribution arrays for the quantities
it sums and writes only the corresponding output arrays. Neither
modifies the pair-contribution buffers, `neighbor_counts`, or any other
particle state. The pair-buffer's energy and virial arrays therefore
hold whatever values the most recent pair-force kernel wrote, regardless
of whether `reduce_pair_energy_virial` was launched this step; the next
launch picks them up.

### PTX Module Loading <!-- rq-56d8375d -->

`init_device()` loads the compiled `kernels/reduce.cu` PTX as module
`"reduce"` and captures both `reduce_pair_forces` and
`reduce_pair_energy_virial` into the `Kernels` handle (see
`build-pipeline.md`).

### Constructor and Accessors <!-- rq-be5fe064 -->

- `PairBuffer::new(device: Arc<CudaDevice>, particle_count: usize, max_neighbors: u32) -> Result<PairBuffer, GpuError>` <!-- rq-79048663 -->
  - Allocates five `CudaSlice<f32>` of length `particle_count * max_neighbors`
    via `CudaDevice::alloc_zeros` (three forces, energy, virial). Every
    slot starts at `0.0_f32`.
  - Returns the populated `PairBuffer`.
  - Returns `Err(GpuError)` on a CUDA driver allocation failure.
  - A `particle_count` of zero or a `max_neighbors` of zero is permitted and
    yields a buffer whose five device allocations have length zero.

- `PairBuffer::particle_count(&self) -> usize` <!-- rq-3c42e6bd -->
  - Returns the value supplied at construction.

- `PairBuffer::max_neighbors(&self) -> u32` <!-- rq-12657190 -->
  - Returns the value supplied at construction.

### Reduction Launchers <!-- rq-6f2452d1 -->

Two free functions in `src/gpu/kernels.rs`, re-exported from
`crate::gpu`:

- `reduce_pair_forces(pair_buffer: &PairBuffer, neighbor_counts: &CudaSlice<u32>, target_force_x: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>, target_force_y: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>, target_force_z: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>, particle_count: usize) -> Result<(), GpuError>` <!-- rq-6690fae9 -->
  - Launches the `reduce_pair_forces` kernel against the three caller-
    supplied force-component target buffers. Overwrites them with the
    per-particle net force from the pair-buffer reduction.
  - Block size is 256; grid size is `particle_count` blocks (one block
    per particle).
  - When `particle_count == 0`, returns `Ok(())` without launching a
    kernel.
  - Returns the underlying `GpuError` if the kernel launch fails.
  - Invokes the kernel through the `reduce_pair_forces` field of the
    `Kernels` handle reached from its arguments; it performs no
    string-keyed kernel lookup of its own (see `build-pipeline.md`).

  The launcher trusts the caller for shape consistency: it asserts (debug
  builds only) that `pair_buffer.particle_count() == particle_count`,
  that `neighbor_counts.len() == particle_count`, that each of the
  three target views has length `particle_count`, and that the
  pair-buffer slices have length
  `particle_count * pair_buffer.max_neighbors()`. Release builds skip
  the asserts for parity with the other kernel launchers.

- `reduce_pair_energy_virial(pair_buffer: &PairBuffer, neighbor_counts: &CudaSlice<u32>, target_energy: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>, target_virial: &mut CudaViewMut<'_, f32>, particle_count: usize) -> Result<(), GpuError>` <!-- rq-c9240ed4 -->
  - Launches the `reduce_pair_energy_virial` kernel against the two
    caller-supplied scalar target buffers. Overwrites them with the
    per-particle potential-energy share and scalar-virial share from
    the pair-buffer reduction.
  - Block size, grid size, empty-state, error, and debug-assertion
    semantics mirror `reduce_pair_forces`, applied to the two scalar
    targets instead of the three force targets.

  Both launchers read `pair_buffer.pair_*` and `neighbor_counts` as
  shared immutable inputs and write only into the targets handed to
  them. A caller that runs the force launcher without the
  energy-virial launcher leaves the corresponding target buffers
  unchanged from their last write.

  Within the pluggable potential framework, the `LennardJonesState` slot
  passes its assigned rows of the framework's flat slot-output buffers
  as the five targets (see `forces/framework.md`).

## Launch Configuration <!-- rq-9be271aa -->

- Block size: 256 threads (8 warps of 32) for both kernels.
- Grid size: `n` blocks in the x dimension — one block per particle —
  for both kernels.
- Shared memory: static, `NUM_WARPS * K * sizeof(f32)` bytes per block
  for a `[NUM_WARPS][K]` array of per-warp partials, where
  `NUM_WARPS = blockDim.x / 32 = 8` and `K` is the number of summed
  quantities — `K = 3` for `reduce_pair_forces` (96 bytes per block),
  `K = 2` for `reduce_pair_energy_virial` (64 bytes per block). Neither
  kernel requests dynamic shared memory at launch.
- Stream: the default stream carried by `pair_buffer.device` for both
  kernels.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-2b7cfbaf -->

- The pair-force kernel that fills `pair_forces_*` (a future feature).
- Construction of `neighbor_counts` (owned by the future neighbor-list
  feature).
- Bonded force terms, electrostatics, accumulation across multiple force
  kernels into the same `forces_*` buffer.
- Splitting the bonded and angle slot reduction kernels (in
  `reduce_bond_forces`, `reduce_angle_forces`) along the same
  force-only / energy-virial boundary. Those reductions are not
  pair-buffer reductions and their cost is small; they continue to
  reduce all five quantities on every call regardless of the requesting
  `AggregateLevel`.
- Sub-block parallelism: multiple particles per block, multi-block
  cooperative reductions over a single particle, persistent-kernel
  schemes. One block reduces exactly one particle.
- Bit-exact equality with a sequential left-to-right CPU reference sum:
  the kernel uses a deterministic block tree reduction whose f32 result
  differs from the scalar serial sum in the low mantissa bits.
- Numerical validation of pair contributions (NaN/Inf propagate).
- The `f64` precision feature flag.
