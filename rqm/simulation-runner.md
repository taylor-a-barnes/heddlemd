# Feature: `heddlemd run` Simulation Runner <!-- rq-357909e4 -->

The simulation runner is the command-line entry point that turns a TOML
configuration file into a complete simulation. It reads the config and the
referenced initial-state file, allocates the GPU pipeline described by
`build-pipeline.md`, `particle-state.md`, `pair-force-kernel.md`,
`lj-pair-force.md`, and the integrator slots in `integration/`, drives the
timestep loop for `simulation.n_steps` iterations, and writes snapshots
and diagnostics at the declared cadences using `trajectory-output.md` and
`log-output.md`.

The runner is the only piece in the project that has visibility of every
subsystem; it is the integration point.

## CLI <!-- rq-82d0c34a -->

The `heddlemd` binary carries three subcommands:

```
heddlemd run     <config-path>
heddlemd lint    <config-path> [--with-gpu]
heddlemd analyze <analysis-path>
```

`<config-path>` is the path to a TOML simulation config (see
`config-schema.md`). `<analysis-path>` is the path to a TOML
analysis config (see `rqm/analysis/framework.md`). Relative paths
are resolved against the current working directory. No environment
variables or configuration sources beyond the input file are
accepted in schema v1; every parameter affecting the trajectory
lives in the simulation config, every parameter affecting an
analysis lives in the analysis config.

Errors are reported as a single line on stderr beginning with
`error: ` followed by a human-readable description that includes the
responsible file path and field name where applicable.

### `run` subcommand <!-- rq-cfb6aadb -->

Executes the simulation described by `<config-path>` to completion.
The full setup-and-loop pipeline is described under *Runner flow*.

- Exit codes:
  - `0` — simulation completed successfully (every requested step ran
    and every requested output flushed).
  - `1` — any error before the loop starts: malformed CLI args, config
    load failure, init-state load failure, output-file overwrite check
    failure, GPU initialisation failure.
  - `2` — error during the loop: a kernel launch failed, a write to
    the trajectory or log failed, or a download from the device
    failed.

### `lint` subcommand <!-- rq-c1d5b25d -->

Validates an input file and its referenced inputs against every
error the runner can detect without executing the integration loop
or trajectory pass, then exits. Dispatches on the input file's
extension:

- `<path>.in.toml` runs the *simulation lint pipeline* described
  under *Lint flow* in this file.
- `<path>.in.analysis` runs the *analyze lint pipeline* described
  under `rqm/analysis/framework.md`'s *Analyze lint flow*.
- Any other extension is rejected with the existing filename-
  convention error variant for the inferred kind.

Designed for HPC contexts where a long submission queue makes
trial-and-error iteration expensive: `heddlemd lint` runs cheaply
on a login node and reports every issue that would cause a `run`
or `analyze` to fail at setup time.

- `--with-gpu` (optional flag) is accepted only for the simulation
  lint pipeline; it extends the lint to include device
  initialisation and full GPU-side setup (see *Lint flow*'s
  *`--with-gpu` stages*). Passing `--with-gpu` to an
  `.in.analysis` path is rejected at CLI-parse time (analysis is
  CPU-only in v1).
- Exit codes:
  - `0` — every check passed.
  - `1` — at least one check failed.
- Lint writes no files for either pipeline. Pre-existing output
  files are detected with `Path::exists()`; the filesystem is
  otherwise unchanged.
- Stops at the first failed check (short-circuit). Subsequent
  stages are reported as **skipped (earlier check failed)** in the
  per-stage report.

### `analyze` subcommand <!-- rq-828c169c -->

Runs every analysis declared in an `<root>.in.analysis` file
against the matching trajectory and writes one CSV per analysis.
The pipeline, input-file schema, registry, and CSV output
conventions are documented in `rqm/analysis/framework.md`; the
first built-in analysis kind is documented in
`rqm/analysis/rdf.md`.

- Exit codes:
  - `0` — every declared analysis ran to completion and every CSV
    flushed.
  - `1` — error before the trajectory pass (filename-convention
    violation, analysis-file parse failure, sibling config load
    failure, trajectory open failure, output-collision failure).
  - `2` — error during the trajectory pass or output write.

### Usage error messages <!-- rq-7e5cb9f8 -->

`heddlemd` with no arguments, an unrecognised subcommand, a
recognised subcommand without its required path argument,
`lint --with-gpu` against an `.in.analysis` path, or `lint` with
any other unrecognised flag prints the following usage block to
stderr and exits with code `1`:

```
usage: heddlemd run     <config-path>
       heddlemd lint    <config-path> [--with-gpu]
       heddlemd analyze <analysis-path>
```

## Runner flow <!-- rq-ef902cf6 -->

A single invocation runs the sequence of phases declared in
`config.phases` (see `config-schema.md`). The unified phase sequence
contains entries of two kinds: MD phases (declared as `[[phase]]`
tables, carried as `PhaseKind::Md(PhaseConfig)`) and minimization
phases (declared as `[[minimization]]` tables, carried as
`PhaseKind::Minimization(MinimizationConfig)`). The order is the
literal source-document order across both arrays (see
`config-schema.md`'s *Phase kinds* section). Setup happens once at
startup; the per-phase loop builds and tears down slot state at
every phase boundary; particle state (positions, velocities,
simulation box, charges) and the global `ForceField` carry over
unchanged between phases regardless of phase kind. Any stage that
fails terminates the process with the appropriate exit code and
stderr message.

The fields below in italics indicate where per-phase versus global
config fields are consulted.

### Once-only setup <!-- rq-d734328e -->

The cross-phase state of a run is owned by a `SimulationSetup` value
(see *Feature API*) constructed once at the start of a run via
`SimulationSetup::new(config_path: &Path, registries: Registries)`.
That constructor executes steps 2–11 below in order. CLI parsing
(step 1) runs in `src/main.rs`'s `cli_main_run` ahead of any
`SimulationSetup` call.

Every setup step is implemented as a step-helper function that is
also consumed by the GPU lint pipeline (see *Lint flow*). The runner
and the linter therefore exercise the same setup code by
construction, not by parallel reimplementation; the only difference
is that the linter records each helper's success or failure into a
`LintStage` and continues to the next stage on failure, whereas
`SimulationSetup::new` short-circuits at the first `Err` and
returns it as a `RunnerError`.

1. **Parse CLI.** Confirm the form `run <config-path>`. Capture
   `<config-path>`.
2. **Load config.** Call `load_config(&config_path)`
   (`config-schema.md`). Failure → exit 1.
3. **Pre-flight output checks.** For every phase `P` in
   `config.phases`, verify each enabled output path
   (`P.output.trajectory_path` when `P.output.trajectory_every > 0`,
   `P.output.log_path` when `P.output.log_every > 0`, and
   `P.output.timings_path` always) does not already exist. The check
   runs across every phase up-front so the runner never starts a
   long, multi-phase job that would fail to write some later phase's
   output. Failure → exit 1 with
   `RunnerError::OutputExists { path }` reporting the first
   pre-existing path encountered (phases checked in declaration
   order).
4. **Build type-name slice.** Construct `type_names: Vec<&str>` from
   `config.particle_types[i].name`, indexed left-to-right.
5. **Load init state.** Call
   `load_init_state(&config.init, &type_names)`
   (`init-state-file.md`). Failure → exit 1.
6. **Build SimulationBox.** From `init_state.box`. This is the box the
   simulation uses; the config does not specify a box. Immediately
   after the box is known, verify the cell-list compatibility check:
   when `config.neighbor_list` is `NeighborListConfig::CellList { r_skin, .. }`,
   the runner computes `cutoff_max` as the largest cutoff across
   `config.pair_interactions`, `config.coulomb.cutoff`, and
   `config.spme.r_cut_real` (whichever are present), forms
   `required = 3 * (cutoff_max + r_skin)`, and delegates the
   per-direction check to
   `sim_box.check_min_perpendicular_width(required)` (see
   `simulation-box.md`). On `Err(SimulationBoxError::PerpendicularWidthTooSmall
   { direction, width, required })` the runner translates the payload
   verbatim into `RunnerError::CellListBoxTooSmall { direction, width,
   required }` and exits with code `1`.
   `NeighborListConfig::AllPairs` skips this check.
6a. **Load topology file (if supplied).** When
    `config.topology.is_some()`, build the slice of bond type names
    from `config.bond_types` and the slice of angle type names from
    `config.angle_types`, call
    `load_topology_file(path, particle_count, &bond_type_names,
    &angle_type_names, &config.constraint_types)`
    (`forces/topology.md`), and capture the resulting `(BondList,
    AngleList, ExclusionList, ConstraintList)`. Failure → exit 1.
    When `config.topology.is_none()`, use an empty `BondList`, an
    empty `AngleList`, an empty `ExclusionList`, and an empty
    `ConstraintList`.
7. **Initialise CUDA.** Call `init_device()` (`build-pipeline.md`).
   Failure → exit 1. When `config.spme.is_some()`, `init_device` runs
   the cuFFT determinism smoke test described in `forces/spme.md`. A
   smoke-test failure surfaces as
   `RunnerError::CuFftNonDeterministic { differences: usize }` and
   exits with code `1`.
8. **Generate velocities (if absent).** When
   `init_state.velocities.is_none()`, sample velocities via the
   Maxwell-Boltzmann procedure described in *Velocity generation*. When
   `Some(_)`, copy directly from the init state.
9. **Construct host particle state.** Build a `ParticleState`
   (`particle-state.md`) with:
   - `positions_*` from `init_state.positions_*`,
   - `velocities_*` from either the init state or the generated values,
   - `masses` populated from
     `config.particle_types[init_state.type_indices[i]].mass` cast to `f32`,
   - `charges` populated from
     `config.particle_types[init_state.type_indices[i]].charge` cast to
     `f32`,
   - `ids = None` (default `0..N`),
   - `forces_*` zero-initialised by the constructor.
10. **Allocate `ParticleBuffers`.** Construct `ParticleBuffers` from
    the host state.
10a. **Project initial velocities onto the constraint manifold.**
    When `constraint_list.is_empty() == false`,
    `config.simulation.temperature > 0.0`, and `N >= 2`, build a
    transient `Constraint` slot via
    `registries.constraint_types.build_optional(&constraint_list,
    &gpu, N, &masses_f32, &config.constraint_types)`. When the
    builder returns `Some(c)`:
    - Call `c.apply_initial_velocity_projection(&mut buffers,
      &sim_box, &mut init_timings)` to project the
      Maxwell-Boltzmann–sampled velocities onto the constraint
      velocity manifold (zeroing the bond-axis component of every
      constraint).
    - Allocate a length-1 `CudaSlice<f32>` scratch buffer; call
      `compute_kinetic_energy(&buffers, &mut ke_scratch)` to read
      the post-projection kinetic energy `ke_after`.
    - When both `ke_after > 0.0` and `target_ke =
      0.5 * n_thermal_dof * config.simulation.temperature` are
      positive, compute `factor = sqrt(target_ke / ke_after)` and
      call `rescale_velocities(&mut buffers, factor)`. The uniform
      scalar rescale preserves both the zero-total-momentum
      invariant established by *Momentum subtraction* and the
      on-manifold velocity field, since for any constrained pair
      `(α v_i − α v_j) · (r_i − r_j) = α · 0 = 0`.

    The transient `Constraint` slot is dropped at the end of this
    step; the per-phase loop builds its own slot from
    `setup.constraint_list` at every phase boundary.

    Without this projection, the per-axis MB sample carries
    components along bond directions that the first SHAKE / SETTLE
    invocation strips off, leaving the system at approximately
    `n_thermal_dof / 3N` of the configured starting temperature
    until a thermostat re-heats it over `~τ_T`.

    Steps `init_constraint.build_optional`, the projection call,
    and the post-projection rescale are skipped entirely on the
    constraint-empty, zero-temperature, or `N < 2` branches.

11. **Construct the force field.** Call
    `ForceField::new(&registries.potentials, device.clone(),
    N, &sim_box, &config.pair_interactions, &config.bond_types,
    &bond_list, &exclusion_list, &config.neighbor_list)` (see
    `forces/framework.md`). The force field is shared across every
    phase: `pair_interactions`, `bond_types`, `angle_types`,
    `coulomb`, `spme`, `neighbor_list`, and the topology-derived
    `BondList` / `AngleList` / `ExclusionList` are all global config
    fields, so a single `ForceField` instance is valid for the whole
    run.

### Per-phase loop <!-- rq-581dbfb8 -->

After `SimulationSetup::new` returns, the runner walks
`setup.config.phases` in declaration order, dispatching each entry
to one of two per-phase functions:

```text
for (phase_index, phase) in setup.config.phases.iter().enumerate():
    match phase:
        PhaseKind::Md(P) =>
            run_md_phase(&mut setup, P, phase_index) -> Result<PhaseSummary, RunnerError>
        PhaseKind::Minimization(P) =>
            run_minimization_phase(&mut setup, P, phase_index) -> Result<PhaseSummary, RunnerError>
```

Both functions take `&mut SimulationSetup`. The cross-phase state
they observe and mutate through that borrow is:

- `setup.buffers: ParticleBuffers` — mutated by every step kernel,
  by the integrator's drift/kick, and by trajectory downloads.
- `setup.sim_box: SimulationBox` — mutated only by barostat phases.
- `setup.force_field: ForceField` — mutated by neighbor-list
  rebuilds; otherwise read-only.

The cross-phase state they observe but never mutate is:

- `setup.config`, `setup.registries`, `setup.gpu`,
  `setup.constraint_list`, `setup.bond_list`, `setup.angle_list`,
  `setup.exclusion_list`, `setup.masses_f32`,
  `setup.n_constraints`, and `setup.n_thermal_dof`.

The per-phase slot handles (`Integrator`, `Thermostat`, `Barostat`
for MD phases; `Minimizer` for minimization phases), the per-phase
`Constraint` slot (rebuilt from `setup.constraint_list`), the
output writers (`TrajectoryWriter`, `LogWriter`, `MinlogWriter`),
and the per-phase `Timings` instance are built fresh inside the
per-phase function at every phase boundary and dropped at every
phase end. Slot internal state (chain variables, conserved-quantity
counters, RNG counters, adaptive step sizes) starts from each
phase's declared seeds and initial values.

`run_md_phase` executes steps 12–20 below. `run_minimization_phase`
follows the corresponding workflow documented in
`rqm/minimization/steepest-descent.md` (slot construction → writer
opening → SD loop → writer flush → timings drain → slot drop); the
minimization phase honours the same particle-state and ForceField
carry-over invariants as the MD branch, never mutating velocities or
the simulation box.

12. **Construct the integrator, thermostat, barostat, and constraint.**
    Build the four slot handles for phase `P` by dispatching through
    the caller-supplied `Registries` bundle (see
    `integration/framework.md` and
    `integration/constraint-framework.md`):
    - `registries.integrators.build(&P.integrator, device.clone(), N)`
      → `Box<dyn Integrator>`.
    - `registries.thermostats.build_optional(P.thermostat.as_ref(),
      device.clone(), N)` → `Option<Box<dyn Thermostat>>`.
    - `registries.barostats.build_optional(P.barostat.as_ref(),
      device.clone(), N)` → `Option<Box<dyn Barostat>>`.
    - `registries.constraint_types.build_optional(&constraint_list,
      device.clone(), N)` → `Option<Box<dyn Constraint>>`. Reuses
      the global `ConstraintList`; returns `None` when the topology
      file's `[constraints]` section is empty or absent.

    Each slot owns any per-run state it needs (e.g. `LosslessBuffers`
    for `velocity-verlet` when `lossless == true`; the chain state
    and `ke_scratch` buffer for `nose-hoover-chain`; the per-group
    snapshot, atom-index, and per-type parameter buffers for
    `settle`). The integrator-owns-its-own-thermostat,
    integrator-owns-its-own-barostat, and
    integrator-supports-constraints compatibility checks (builder
    predicates `IntegratorBuilder::owns_thermostat(&params)`,
    `owns_barostat(&params)`, and `supports_constraints(&params)`
    queried per phase via `Config::validate_against(&registries)`
    and
    `Config::validate_constraint_compatibility(&registries, has_constraints)`)
    have already been enforced at this point; no runtime guard is
    required here.

    The constraint slot is threaded through the runner's plan walk
    (via the `run_step` helper in `integration/framework.md`); see
    that file for the dispatch sequence.

13. **Open per-phase output writers.** Open `TrajectoryWriter`
    and/or `LogWriter` for phase `P` using
    `P.output.trajectory_path`, `P.output.log_path`, and the
    `include_velocities` / `include_images` flags from `P.output`.
    The `LogWriter` is opened with the concatenation of every active
    slot's extra-column names, in dispatch order:
    `integrator.log_column_names() ++ thermostat.map(|t|
    t.log_column_names()).unwrap_or_default() ++ barostat.map(|b|
    b.log_column_names()).unwrap_or_default()`. The runner caches the
    concatenated slice for the duration of phase `P`. When that
    cached slice is non-empty, the runner additionally allocates a
    length-1 `CudaSlice<f32>` named `pe_scratch` (the per-log-row
    scratch buffer passed to `compute_total_potential_energy` in
    steps 15 and 16.f). The PE scratch is freed at end of phase along
    with the slot handles. Failure → exit 1.

14. **Initialise per-phase `Timings`.** Construct a fresh `Timings`
    instance for phase `P` (`Timings::new(&gpu)`). For phase 0 only,
    the runner replays the three pre-instrumented host stages
    (`config_load`, `init_load`, `gpu_init`) into this Timings as
    static one-shot samples; subsequent phases' Timings start empty.

15. **Warm up forces.** Call
    `force_field.step(&mut buffers, &sim_box, &mut timings)` once to
    populate `forces_*` with the force vector at the phase's initial
    positions. For phase 0 this is `F(x_0)`. For later phases this
    re-computes the force at the carried-over positions; the result
    is bit-identical to what the previous phase's last
    `integrator.step` left in the buffer (the carry-over of
    `forces_*` is guaranteed by the per-phase invariant
    `forces ↔ positions` documented in `pipeline-reproducibility.md`),
    so the redundant compute is a determinism safety net rather than
    a correctness requirement.

16. **Write phase step-0 outputs.** When `P.output.trajectory_every >
    0`, download the relevant buffers and call
    `write_frame(step=0, ...)` on the phase trajectory writer. When
    `P.output.log_every > 0`, download `velocities_*` and `masses`
    (the `masses` download is cached for the remainder of phase `P`),
    compute KE and T via `compute_kinetic_energy` and
    `compute_temperature` (`log-output.md`); if the cached
    extra-column slice is non-empty, additionally call
    `compute_total_potential_energy(&buffers, &mut pe_scratch)` to
    obtain the total PE via a single-block deterministic GPU
    reduction (one f32 scalar downloaded; no per-particle download),
    and assemble the extras vector as the concatenation of each
    slot's `log_column_values(ke, pe)` in dispatch order
    (integrator, thermostat, barostat). Call
    `write_row(0, 0.0, ke, t, &extras)`. The `step` and `time`
    columns are **phase-local** (the phase always starts at step 0,
    time 0.0).

17. **Phase timestep loop.** The runner takes one of two shapes
    depending on whether the phase is eligible for CUDA graph mode
    (see `cuda-graphs.md` for the activation policy).

    **Per-step launch loop (graph-ineligible phases or
    `[simulation].cuda_graphs_disable = true`).** For each step `s`
    in `1 ..= P.n_steps`:

    a. If `thermostat.is_some()`,
       `thermostat.apply_pre(&mut buffers, P.dt, &mut timings)`.
    b. `integrator.step(&mut buffers, &mut sim_box, &mut force_field,
       P.dt, &mut timings)`.
    c. If `thermostat.is_some()`,
       `thermostat.apply_post(&mut buffers, P.dt, &mut timings)`.
    d. If `barostat.is_some()`,
       `barostat.apply(&mut buffers, &mut sim_box, P.dt, &mut timings)`.

    The force evaluation inside `integrator.step` (step b) runs at
    `AggregateLevel::ForcesAndScalars` — computing the total potential
    energy and virial — only when the step produces a log row
    (`P.output.log_every > 0` and `s % P.output.log_every == 0`) or a
    barostat is active; otherwise it runs at
    `AggregateLevel::ForcesOnly`. A trajectory frame carries positions
    and velocities, and the thermostat reduces kinetic energy from
    velocities independently, so neither requires force-kernel scalars.
    The CUDA graph path selects between its forces-only and
    forces+scalars graphs on the same condition (see `cuda-graphs.md`).

    The loop variable `s` is local to the phase and gates trajectory
    and log writes below; it is not passed to any slot.

    e. If `P.output.trajectory_every > 0` and
       `s % P.output.trajectory_every == 0`, download positions (and
       velocities when configured) and call
       `write_frame(step=s, ...)`. The `Time=` attribute is computed
       as `s as f64 * P.dt` — phase-local time.
    f. If `P.output.log_every > 0` and
       `s % P.output.log_every == 0`, download velocities, compute KE
       and T, optionally compute total PE (when extras are non-empty),
       and call `write_row(s, s as f64 * P.dt, ke, t, &extras)`.
    g. Possibly emit a progress line (see *Progress reporting*).

    `force_field.step` invokes `NeighborListState::pre_step` once per
    call, so the displacement check fires on every physical step.

    **Batched graph-replay loop (eligible phases).** The runner
    captures a `GraphLoop` once at phase start as described in
    `cuda-graphs.md`'s *Capture Lifecycle*. The captured iteration
    is physical step 1. The remaining `P.n_steps - 1` steps run as
    a sequence of batches whose size is

    ```
    batch = min(P.graph_batch_size, remaining, next_log, next_traj)
    ```

    where `next_log` / `next_traj` are the steps until the next log
    / trajectory cadence boundary. Each batch invokes
    `graph_loop.launch(stream)` exactly `batch` times in sequence.

    At each batch boundary the runner runs `nl.pre_step`
    (displacement check + optional rebuild) and then, if the new
    step index aligns with a log or trajectory cadence, calls
    `sim_box.flush_from_device()`, drains any per-slot
    `flush_pending_injection`, and performs the output write as
    above. When `nl.pre_step` reports that a rebuild reallocated a
    packed-neighbour buffer, the runner re-captures the phase
    `GraphLoop` before the next batch (see `cuda-graphs.md`'s
    *Neighbor-List Pre-Step Decomposition*); stream capture records
    without executing, so the re-capture consumes no physical step. If
    the re-capture itself fails, the remaining steps run on the
    per-step launch loop.

    `force_field.step_no_neighbor_check` is the variant used inside
    the captured graph and inside the batched-replay code path; it
    is identical to `force_field.step` except that it does not call
    `NeighborListState::pre_step`.

    The `dt` value passed to integrator launches is `P.dt as f32`
    in both loop shapes.

18. **Flush and close per-phase writers.** Call `flush()` on the
    open trajectory and log writers and drop them. Writers' `Drop`
    impls are best-effort but the runner calls `flush` explicitly
    so flush errors propagate.

19. **Write per-phase timings file.** Capture the
    phase-elapsed-runtime measurement (a per-phase `total_runtime`
    sample), drain outstanding CUDA event pairs via
    `Timings::finalize`, and serialise the resulting report to
    `P.output.timings_path` via `write_timings_file`. See
    `performance-analysis.md` for the file format. The Timings
    instance is dropped at end of phase.

20. **Drop slot handles.** The phase's `Integrator`, `Thermostat`,
    `Barostat`, and `Constraint` boxes are dropped, releasing their
    GPU-side buffers. The persistent state owned by `ParticleBuffers`
    (positions, velocities, masses, charges) and by the `ForceField`
    (neighbor list, pair buffer, slot parameter buffers) is
    unaffected.

### After the loop <!-- rq-0864e90f -->

21. **Final summary.** Emit one summary line to stdout (see
    *Final summary*). Exit 0.

KE/temperature computation uses `f64` arithmetic on `f32`-downloaded
values throughout, in every phase.

## Lint flow <!-- rq-c02c6b45 -->

`heddlemd lint <config-path> [--with-gpu]` exercises every setup-phase
check `run` performs, but stops after the last setup check, writes no
output files, and never enters the integration loop. The pipeline
reuses the same loader functions, the same validators, and the same
error types as *Runner flow*; the only differences are the absence of
side effects (no writer opens, no trajectory frames, no `.timings`
file) and the optional skipping of every GPU-touching stage.

### Stage order <!-- rq-23f05652 -->

Stages run in the order below. Outcomes are recorded into a
`LintReport` (see *Feature API*); a failed stage marks every
subsequent stage as **skipped (earlier check failed)**.

#### Always-on stages (CPU only) <!-- rq-65a63eec -->

1. **`config`** — `load_config(&config_path)` (when `with_gpu = false`)
   or `load_config_raw(&config_path)` followed by
   `config.validate_against(&registries)` and
   `config.validate_constraint_compatibility(&registries,
   has_constraints)` (when `with_gpu = true`, to match `run`'s
   registry dispatch). Covers the filename-convention check, TOML
   parse, every per-field domain check, path-collision check, and
   per-kind registry dispatch.
2. **`output paths`** — for each enabled output path
   (`trajectory_path` when `trajectory_every > 0`, `log_path` when
   `log_every > 0`, `timings_path` always), test with
   `Path::exists()`. A pre-existing file is a FAIL carrying the same
   payload (`RunnerError::OutputExists { path }`) that `run`'s
   pre-flight surfaces. No file is created or removed; multiple
   pre-existing paths are detected but only the first is reported as
   the stage failure (consistent with the short-circuit semantics).
3. **`init`** — `load_init_state(&config.init, &type_names)`. On
   success the stage description carries the particle count and the
   box dimensions extracted from `init_state.box`.
4. **`box/cutoff`** — when `config.neighbor_list` is `CellList`,
   compute `cutoff_max` as in *Runner flow* step 6 and call
   `sim_box.check_min_perpendicular_width(3 * (cutoff_max + r_skin))`.
   A failure surfaces as `RunnerError::CellListBoxTooSmall { .. }`.
   When `config.neighbor_list` is `AllPairs`, the stage is recorded
   as **not applicable (mode = all-pairs)** and is not a failure.
5. **`topology`** — when `config.topology.is_some()`, call
   `load_topology_file(...)` as in *Runner flow* step 6a and record
   the bond, angle, and constraint-group counts on success. When
   `config.topology.is_none()`, the stage is recorded as **not
   supplied** and is not a failure.

#### `--with-gpu` stages <!-- rq-688fb553 -->

6. **`gpu`** — when `with_gpu = true`, exercises every GPU-touching
   setup helper that `SimulationSetup::new` exercises, in the same
   order: `init_device()` (step 7, including the cuFFT determinism
   smoke test when SPME is configured), velocity generation (step 8,
   when the init file omits velocities), `ParticleState::new`
   (step 9), the host-to-device upload via `ParticleBuffers::new`
   (step 10), the initial-velocity constraint projection and
   rescale (step 10a), and `ForceField::new` (step 11). For each
   phase in `config.phases`, additionally runs the per-kind slot
   builders (integrator / thermostat / barostat / constraint for MD
   phases; minimizer / constraint for minimization phases) so any
   per-phase geometric or allocation failure surfaces under lint.
   Stops before opening any per-phase output writer. Any error from
   these helpers — `RunnerError::Gpu`,
   `RunnerError::CuFftNonDeterministic`,
   `RunnerError::Integrator`, `RunnerError::Thermostat`,
   `RunnerError::Barostat`, `RunnerError::Constraint`,
   `RunnerError::ForceField`, `RunnerError::ParticleState`,
   `RunnerError::Minimizer` — surfaces as the stage failure.

   The implementation invokes the same step-helper functions that
   `SimulationSetup::new` invokes, so any change to a setup
   helper's behaviour is observed by both code paths.

   When `with_gpu = false`, the stage is recorded as **not checked
   (re-run with `--with-gpu`)** unconditionally; no GPU device is
   opened and no allocation is attempted.

### Output format <!-- rq-25185894 -->

On exit, the runner emits the lint report on stdout, followed by a
single-line error summary on stderr when at least one stage failed.
Each per-stage line is formatted as a left-aligned 12-column label, a
single space, and a description.

Successful CPU-only example:

```
[heddlemd lint] OK
  config       /tmp/sim/argon.in.toml
  output paths none pre-exist
  init         resolved, 10000 particles, box 8.0e-9 × 8.0e-9 × 1.0e-8 m
  box/cutoff   min perp width 8.0e-9 m ≥ required 3.30e-9 m
  topology     not supplied
  gpu          not checked (re-run with --with-gpu)
```

Successful `--with-gpu` example:

```
[heddlemd lint] OK
  config       /tmp/sim/argon.in.toml
  output paths none pre-exist
  init         resolved, 10000 particles, box 8.0e-9 × 8.0e-9 × 1.0e-8 m
  box/cutoff   min perp width 8.0e-9 m ≥ required 3.30e-9 m
  topology     not supplied
  gpu          init_device OK; ParticleBuffers, slots, ForceField allocated
```

Failure at `box/cutoff` (CPU-only):

```
[heddlemd lint] FAIL
  config       /tmp/sim/argon.in.toml
  output paths none pre-exist
  init         resolved, 10000 particles, box 2.0e-9 × 5.0e-9 × 5.0e-9 m
  box/cutoff   FAIL — min perp width 2.0e-9 m along `a` < required 3.30e-9 m
  topology     skipped (earlier check failed)
  gpu          not checked (re-run with --with-gpu)
error: simulation box perpendicular width along lattice direction `a` is 2e-9, below the required 3.3e-9
```

Failure at `config` (filename-convention violation):

```
[heddlemd lint] FAIL
  config       FAIL — /tmp/sim/argon.toml does not end in `.in.toml`
  output paths skipped (earlier check failed)
  init         skipped (earlier check failed)
  box/cutoff   skipped (earlier check failed)
  topology     skipped (earlier check failed)
  gpu          skipped (earlier check failed)
error: config filename `/tmp/sim/argon.toml` does not end in `.in.toml` (or its derived root is empty)
```

Description text is descriptive prose, not machine-parsed. The
canonical, parseable surface for callers is the `LintReport` returned
by `lint_simulation` (see *Feature API*); the stdout block is for
human consumption.

## Velocity generation <!-- rq-2be8ef35 -->

When the init file does not supply velocities, the runner samples them from
a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at `config.simulation.temperature` using a
deterministic RNG seeded by `config.simulation.seed`. Sampling is followed
by a centre-of-mass momentum subtraction and a single-scalar rescale, so the
generated array's thermodynamic temperature equals the configured target
(within f32 storage round-off) for any system with at least one thermal
degree of freedom (`N_thermal_dof >= 1`, where `N_thermal_dof =
max(0, 3 * N - n_constraints - 3)`). The procedure is fully specified so
that two runs with identical config and identical init files (including
identical constraint topology) produce byte-identical velocity arrays.

### RNG <!-- rq-1b7680ad -->

The runner constructs `rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng::seed_from_u64(seed)`. This
yields a deterministic sequence across `rand_chacha 0.3` patch releases.
The `rand_chacha` and `rand` crates are added as runtime dependencies of
the `heddle-md` crate.

### Sampling order <!-- rq-2249f685 -->

Velocities are generated in nested loop order: particle index outer, axis
inner (x, y, z). For each `(particle, axis)`, the runner consumes two `f64`
uniforms `(u1, u2)` from the RNG and computes one normal sample via
Box-Muller; the second Box-Muller sample is discarded to keep the
specification trivial.

```
for i in 0..N:
    for axis in (x, y, z):
        u1 = sample_uniform_open(rng)   # f64 in (0.0, 1.0]
        u2 = sample_uniform_unit(rng)   # f64 in [0.0, 1.0)
        z  = sqrt(-2.0 * ln(u1)) * cos(2.0 * pi * u2)
        sigma = sqrt(T / (masses[i] as f64))
        v_high_precision = z * sigma
        v[axis][i] = v_high_precision as f32
```

- `sample_uniform_open(rng)`: draws an `f64` in `(0.0, 1.0]`. Use
  `1.0 - rng.gen::<f64>()` where `rng.gen::<f64>()` returns `[0.0, 1.0)`.
- `sample_uniform_unit(rng)`: draws an `f64` in `[0.0, 1.0)` directly via
  `rng.gen::<f64>()`.
- `k_B = 1` exactly in the engine's Hartree atomic units, so no
  Boltzmann constant appears in `sigma`. `T` is the
  `simulation.temperature` value stored on `Config` (carrying
  `k_B · T` in Hartrees); `masses[i]` is in electron masses; the
  resulting `sigma` is in atomic-unit velocity.

When `temperature == 0.0`, every velocity is `0.0_f32`. The runner takes
the explicit `T == 0.0` shortcut to avoid generating samples that all
scale by zero (and to skip the momentum-subtraction step).

### Momentum subtraction <!-- rq-8e239d36 -->

After all velocities are sampled (but before they are uploaded to the
device), the runner subtracts the per-axis centre-of-mass velocity so that
total momentum is zero.

```
total_mass = sum(masses[i] as f64 for i in 0..N)
if total_mass > 0.0 and N > 0:
    for axis in (x, y, z):
        p = sum(masses[i] as f64 * v[axis][i] as f64 for i in 0..N)
        v_com = p / total_mass
        for i in 0..N:
            v[axis][i] = ((v[axis][i] as f64) - v_com) as f32
```

When `N == 0` the subtraction is skipped (no particles to centre). When
`temperature == 0.0` the subtraction is skipped (every velocity is already
zero).

### Temperature rescaling <!-- inline --> <!-- rq-be568071 -->

After the momentum subtraction, when the system has at least one thermal
degree of freedom (`N_thermal_dof = max(0, 3 * N - n_constraints - 3) >= 1`),
the runner rescales every velocity by a single scalar so the realised
kinetic energy matches the equipartition target
`(N_thermal_dof / 2) * k_B * T`. The runner reads `n_constraints` from the
parsed `ConstraintList` (the sum of every group's `constraint_count`; zero
when no `[constraints]` section is present). This matches the
degrees-of-freedom convention used by `compute_temperature`
(see `io/log-output.md`), so the generated array's reported temperature
equals `config.simulation.temperature`.

```
n_thermal_dof = max(0, 3 * N - n_constraints - 3)
if n_thermal_dof == 0:
    # no thermal degrees of freedom remain after centring and constraints
    for i in 0..N:
        for axis in (x, y, z):
            v[axis][i] = 0.0
else:
    ke = sum(0.5 * (masses[i] as f64) *
             ((v_x[i] as f64)^2 + (v_y[i] as f64)^2 + (v_z[i] as f64)^2)
             for i in 0..N)
    if ke > 0.0:
        target_ke = 0.5 * (n_thermal_dof as f64) * k_B * T
        scale = sqrt(target_ke / ke)
        for i in 0..N:
            for axis in (x, y, z):
                v[axis][i] = ((v[axis][i] as f64) * scale) as f32
```

The kinetic-energy sum and the scale factor are computed in `f64`; each
rescaled component is stored back as `f32`. Reading the result back through
`compute_temperature` therefore recovers `T` to within f32
velocity-storage round-off.

The rescale targets the thermodynamic kinetic energy of the
constraint- and COM-removed velocity field. Edge cases:

- `temperature == 0.0` — velocity generation returns zero velocities
  before sampling, the momentum subtraction, or the rescale ever run.
- `N == 0` — there are no particles; the velocity arrays are empty.
- `n_thermal_dof == 0` — no thermal degrees of freedom remain. Covers
  `N <= 1` (a single centred particle is its own centre of mass) and
  pathologically over-constrained systems. Every velocity component is
  set to exactly zero; the rescale is skipped to avoid amplifying
  floating-point residuals into spurious thermal motion.
- `n_thermal_dof >= 1` with a positive post-subtraction kinetic energy
  — every component is multiplied by `scale`. The `ke > 0.0` guard
  also covers the measure-zero degenerate case in which every sampled
  velocity is identical, in which case the velocities are left as the
  momentum subtraction produced them.

The rescale is a single deterministic scalar multiply, so it preserves both
the determinism of velocity generation and the zero-total-momentum property
established by the momentum subtraction.

### Empty init velocities <!-- rq-e6552df6 -->

When `init_state.velocities = Some(_)`, the velocities are used directly:
the RNG is not consulted, and neither the momentum subtraction nor the
rescale is applied. The caller is presumed to have set velocities
deliberately; `compute_temperature` reports their thermodynamic
temperature as-is, dividing by the same `N_thermal_dof` used everywhere
else in the runner (see `io/log-output.md`).

## Progress reporting <!-- rq-73fbb111 -->

The runner emits a progress line to stdout at the start of the loop, at
approximately each 1% completion (i.e. every `max(1, n_steps / 100)` steps),
and at completion. Each line has the form:

```
[heddlemd] step 1000/10000 (10.0%) — 3.2e4 steps/sec
```

Step counts past `n_steps / 100` rounding always include the final step.
Progress lines are not emitted when stdout is not a TTY; in that case the
runner emits only the final-summary line. The TTY check is made once at
startup. (Implementations may use `std::io::IsTerminal` from std.)

## Final summary <!-- rq-d29872e4 -->

After every phase has completed and its writers have been flushed,
the runner emits one line per phase plus a final aggregate line to
stdout. Example for a two-phase config:

```
[heddlemd] phase `equil`: 5000 steps in 96 ms (frames: 0, log rows: 51)
[heddlemd] phase `prod`: 10000 steps in 312 ms (frames: 101, log rows: 101)
[heddlemd] complete: 2 phases, 15000 steps in 410 ms
```

Per-phase lines carry:

- "phase `<name>`" — the phase's `name` from `config.phases[i].name`.
- "<n> steps" — the phase's `n_steps`.
- The wall-clock elapsed time for that phase (start of warm-up to end
  of writer flushes), formatted in `ms` with no fractional digits
  when `>= 10 ms` and in `µs` when shorter.
- "frames" — the number of trajectory frames written for that phase
  (zero when the phase's `trajectory_every == 0`).
- "log rows" — the number of CSV rows written for that phase,
  excluding the header (zero when the phase's `log_every == 0`).

The final aggregate line carries the phase count, the sum of every
phase's `n_steps`, and the total wall-clock from the start of phase 0
to the end of the last phase's writer flushes (including any
inter-phase setup and teardown). Per-phase and aggregate times
together account for the full run cost.

## Feature API <!-- rq-02edd314 -->

The runner exposes two entry points: `run_simulation` (executes the
full pipeline) and `lint_simulation` (validates the setup phase and
returns a structured report). The CLI in `src/main.rs` is a thin
wrapper that dispatches between the two on the first CLI argument.

### Types <!-- rq-77c1d5d9 -->

- `RunnerError` — error type returned from `run_simulation`. Variants: <!-- rq-8ee27e27 -->
  - `Config(ConfigError)` — from `load_config`.
  - `InitState(InitStateError)` — from `load_init_state`.
  - `ParticleState(ParticleStateError)` — from `ParticleState::new` or
    buffer transfer.
  - `Gpu(GpuError)` — from `init_device`, buffer allocation, or kernel
    launch.
  - `Integrator(IntegratorError)` — from `Integrator::new` or the per-step
    methods on the chosen integrator variant (see
    `integration/framework.md`).
  - `TopologyFile(TopologyFileError)` — from `load_topology_file`
    (see `forces/topology.md`).
  - `ForceField(ForceFieldError)` — from `ForceField::new` or
    `ForceField::step` (see `forces/framework.md`).
  - `Trajectory(TrajectoryWriterError)` — from trajectory writer
    construction or `write_frame`/`flush`.
  - `Log(LogWriterError)` — from log writer construction or `write_row`/
    `flush`.
  - `Timings(TimingsError)` — from `Timings::new`, kernel-event
    recording, or `Timings::finalize`.
  - `TimingsWriter(TimingsWriterError)` — from `write_timings_file`.
  - `MissingArgs` — CLI invoked without the required `<config-path>` arg.
  - `OutputExists { path: PathBuf }` — pre-flight check before the init
    file is read; surfaces the same condition the writers detect at
    open time, but earlier.
  - `CellListBoxTooSmall { direction: &'static str, width: f32, required: f32 }`
    — when `config.neighbor_list` is `CellList`, the box read from the
    init file has a perpendicular width along some lattice direction
    that is shorter than `3 * (cutoff_max + r_skin)`, where `cutoff_max`
    is the largest cutoff across `config.pair_interactions`,
    `config.coulomb.cutoff`, and `config.spme.r_cut_real` (whichever
    are present). `direction` is one of `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`. The
    payload is filled by translating
    `SimulationBoxError::PerpendicularWidthTooSmall` returned by
    `sim_box.check_min_perpendicular_width(required)` (see
    `simulation-box.md`); the runner aggregates `cutoff_max`,
    computes `required = 3 * (cutoff_max + r_skin)`, and invokes the
    method.
  - `CuFftNonDeterministic { differences: usize }` — `init_device`'s
    cuFFT determinism smoke test detected `differences > 0` bytes
    differing between two consecutive R2C transforms of the same
    input. Raised only when `config.spme.is_some()`. Indicates the
    host's cuFFT installation does not meet SPME's reproducibility
    contract.
  - `Minimizer(MinimizerError)` — from `Minimizer::step` or from
    minimizer-slot construction (see
    `rqm/minimization/steepest-descent.md`). Wraps the underlying
    `MinimizerError` variants (`Gpu`, `Timings`, `ForceField`,
    `Constraint`, `UnknownKind`).
  - `MinimizerNonConvergence { phase: String, iterations: u64, final_force: f64, final_step: f64 }`
    — a `[[minimization]]` phase reached `max_iterations` without
    meeting any physical convergence criterion. Surfaces as exit
    code `2` (failure during the loop). `final_force` is the
    `F_max` at the last accepted state in `E_h / a_0` (the engine's
    atomic force unit); `final_step` is the adaptive step size in
    Bohr at the time of giving up.
  - `MinlogWriter(MinlogWriterError)` — from minlog-writer
    construction or `write_row`/`flush`.

- `LintReport` — structured result of `lint_simulation`. All fields <!-- rq-a831fb00 -->
  are `pub`. Carries one `LintStage` per stage of the lint pipeline
  in execution order:
  - `stages: Vec<LintStage>` — the per-stage outcomes. Length is
    exactly `6` (one entry per stage label listed in *Lint flow*'s
    *Stage order*) so callers can index by position; the canonical
    label for each entry is also carried by the `LintStage` itself.
  - `overall: LintOverall` — `Ok` iff every stage's `status` is
    `Ok`, `Skipped`, or `NotChecked`; `Fail` iff at least one stage's
    status is `Fail`.

  Methods:
  - `ok(&self) -> bool` — `self.overall == LintOverall::Ok`.
  - `first_failure(&self) -> Option<&RunnerError>` — returns the
    `RunnerError` carried by the first `LintStage` whose status is
    `Fail`, or `None` when no stage failed.
  - `write_to(&self, w: &mut dyn std::io::Write) -> std::io::Result<()>`
    — emits the human-readable per-stage block documented in
    *Lint flow*'s *Output format*: a `[heddlemd lint] OK` or
    `[heddlemd lint] FAIL` header followed by one indented line per
    stage. Does **not** emit the trailing `error: ...` line; that
    line is written to stderr by the CLI wrapper using
    `first_failure().map(|e| format!("error: {e}"))`.

- `LintStage` — one row of the report. Fields: <!-- rq-334f5685 -->
  - `label: &'static str` — one of `"config"`, `"output paths"`,
    `"init"`, `"box/cutoff"`, `"topology"`, `"gpu"` (the
    column-1 text rendered by `write_to`).
  - `status: LintStatus` — see below.

- `LintStatus` — per-stage outcome. Variants: <!-- rq-ff560c3b -->
  - `Ok { detail: String }` — the stage ran to completion. `detail`
    is the human-readable description rendered after the label
    (e.g. `"resolved, 10000 particles, box 8.0e-9 × 8.0e-9 × 1.0e-8 m"`).
  - `Fail { detail: String, error: RunnerError }` — the stage ran
    and reported an error. `detail` is a short summary suitable for
    the per-stage line (rendered as `"FAIL — {detail}"` by
    `write_to`); `error` is the canonical structured error and is
    the value returned by `LintReport::first_failure` (for the first
    such stage).
  - `Skipped { reason: String }` — an earlier stage failed (or this
    stage was not applicable). Examples: `"earlier check failed"`,
    `"not supplied"`, `"not applicable (mode = all-pairs)"`.
  - `NotChecked { reason: String }` — the stage was deliberately not
    attempted by the current lint mode. The `gpu` stage carries this
    status when `with_gpu = false`, with `reason = "re-run with
    --with-gpu"`.

- `LintOverall` — `enum { Ok, Fail }`. `LintReport::overall` is `Ok` <!-- rq-30c21c70 -->
  iff no stage has a `Fail` status.

- `SimulationSetup` — public struct owning every piece of cross-phase <!-- rq-b1a2d006 -->
  state that a run requires. Lives at `heddle_md::runner::SimulationSetup`
  and is also re-exported at `heddle_md::SimulationSetup` alongside
  `Registries`.

  Fields (all `pub`; the rqm enumerates them so external callers can
  rely on direct access for advanced setup-only tests and for
  scenario-driving binaries):

  - `config: Config` — the parsed and validated `Config` from
    `load_config_raw` plus `validate_against` /
    `validate_constraint_compatibility`.
  - `registries: Registries` — the registries bundle the caller
    supplied to `SimulationSetup::new`.
  - `gpu: GpuContext` — the `init_device()` result; provides the
    `Arc<CudaDevice>` carried into every kernel launch.
  - `buffers: ParticleBuffers` — the device-resident particle state.
  - `sim_box: SimulationBox` — the simulation cell.
  - `force_field: ForceField` — the cross-phase force-field handle.
  - `constraint_list: ConstraintList` — the topology's
    constraint-group list, used per-phase to construct a fresh
    `Constraint` slot.
  - `bond_list: BondList`, `angle_list: AngleList`,
    `exclusion_list: ExclusionList` — the topology's bonded / excluded
    pair structure, captured once for diagnostic re-use by the
    minimization phase's logging.
  - `masses_f32: Vec<f32>`, `charges_f32: Vec<f32>` — per-particle
    mass and charge arrays in `f32`, kept on the host for use by
    per-phase constraint-slot construction.
  - `type_indices: Vec<u32>` — per-particle type-index slice copied
    from the init file. Kept on the host because the per-phase
    trajectory writer consumes it for every frame; the original
    `InitState` is released at the end of `SimulationSetup::new`.
  - `n_constraints: u32`, `n_thermal_dof: u32` — the thermal
    degrees-of-freedom decomposition used by every
    `compute_temperature` call across phases.
  - `pre_phase_durations: PrePhaseDurations` — the pre-instrumented
    host-stage durations (`config_load`, `init_load`, `gpu_init`,
    `velocity_generation`, `upload`) captured by step helpers during
    setup. Replayed into phase-0 `Timings` as static one-shot samples
    by `run_md_phase` / `run_minimization_phase` (only on
    `phase_index == 0`).

  Constructor:

  - `SimulationSetup::new(config_path: &Path, registries: Registries) -> Result<SimulationSetup, RunnerError>`
    - Runs steps 2–11 of *Once-only setup* in order, calling the
      corresponding step helpers and threading their outputs into
      the struct's fields.
    - Short-circuits at the first `Err` from any step helper.
      Returns the original `RunnerError` variant unchanged.
    - Does not open per-phase output writers, does not construct any
      per-phase slot handle, and does not modify any file on disk.

  Method:

  - `SimulationSetup::run_all_phases(&mut self) -> Result<RunSummary, RunnerError>`
    - Iterates `self.config.phases` in declaration order, dispatching
      `PhaseKind::Md(P)` to `run_md_phase(self, P, phase_index)` and
      `PhaseKind::Minimization(P)` to
      `run_minimization_phase(self, P, phase_index)`.
    - Aggregates per-phase `PhaseSummary` values into a `RunSummary`
      and returns it on success.
    - Surfaces any `RunnerError` from a per-phase function unchanged
      and stops at the first failing phase.

  `Drop` releases the device buffers owned by `buffers` and
  `force_field`, then drops the `gpu: GpuContext` (which closes the
  CUDA context). No file handle is owned by `SimulationSetup`.

### Functions <!-- rq-e5e4b048 -->

- `run_simulation(config_path: &Path) -> Result<RunSummary, RunnerError>` <!-- rq-1fc57c00 -->
  - Convenience wrapper. Equivalent to
    `run_simulation_with_registries(config_path, &Registries::with_builtins())`.
  - Used by `main.rs` and by every caller that wants the default
    built-in registries.

- `run_simulation_with_registries(config_path: &Path, registries: &Registries) -> Result<RunSummary, RunnerError>` <!-- rq-a71cef31 -->
  - Executes the entire runner flow described above, dispatching
    every `[integrator]`, `[thermostat]`, `[barostat]`,
    `[[constraint_types]]`, and force-slot `kind` through
    `registries`. Used by callers that have registered custom
    builders.
  - Reads and parses the config file via `load_config_raw` (the
    structural-validation-only entry point), then runs
    `Config::validate_against(&registries)` and
    `Config::validate_constraint_compatibility(&registries, has_constraints)`
    with the caller-supplied registries. Any `ConfigError` returned
    by either method is wrapped in `RunnerError::Config`.
  - Uses `registries.potentials` instead of constructing
    `PotentialRegistry::with_builtins()` internally.
  - Returns a `RunSummary` carrying the step count, frame count, log
    row count, and elapsed time on success.
  - Body is the two-line composition
    `let mut setup = SimulationSetup::new(config_path, registries.clone())?;
    setup.run_all_phases()`. The function exists for compatibility
    with existing callers that pass a `&Path` and a `&Registries` and
    want a `RunSummary` back; callers that want fine-grained per-phase
    control construct `SimulationSetup` directly and walk phases via
    the per-phase functions below.

- `run_md_phase(setup: &mut SimulationSetup, phase: &PhaseConfig, phase_index: usize) -> Result<PhaseSummary, RunnerError>` <!-- rq-63d694e9 -->
  - Executes steps 12–20 of *Per-phase loop* for one MD phase.
  - Constructs the integrator, thermostat, barostat, and per-phase
    `Constraint` slot inside the function; drops every slot handle
    on return.
  - Opens and flushes the per-phase `TrajectoryWriter`, `LogWriter`,
    and `Timings`; writes the per-phase `.timings` file before
    returning.
  - Mutates `setup.buffers`, `setup.sim_box` (barostat phases only),
    and `setup.force_field` (neighbor-list rebuilds). Every other
    `setup.*` field is observed read-only.
  - On `phase_index == 0`, replays the host-stage durations from
    `setup.pre_phase_durations` into the per-phase `Timings`; later
    phases skip the replay.
  - Surfaces any underlying `RunnerError` unchanged.

- `run_minimization_phase(setup: &mut SimulationSetup, phase: &MinimizationConfig, phase_index: usize) -> Result<PhaseSummary, RunnerError>` <!-- rq-10903c8d -->
  - Executes the minimization workflow documented in
    `rqm/minimization/steepest-descent.md` for one minimization
    phase.
  - Constructs the minimizer and the per-phase `Constraint` slot
    inside the function; drops both on return.
  - Opens and flushes the per-phase `MinlogWriter` and `Timings`;
    writes the per-phase `.timings` file before returning.
  - Never mutates `setup.sim_box` or velocities; positions and
    forces in `setup.buffers` are mutated as the minimization
    proceeds.
  - On `phase_index == 0`, replays `setup.pre_phase_durations` into
    the per-phase `Timings` exactly as `run_md_phase` does.
  - Surfaces any underlying `RunnerError` (`Minimizer`,
    `MinimizerNonConvergence`, `Constraint`, `Gpu`, `Timings`,
    `TimingsWriter`, `MinlogWriter`) unchanged.

- `RunSummary` fields: <!-- rq-5c1cfc93 -->
  - `phases: Vec<PhaseSummary>` — one entry per phase in declaration
    order. Length equals `config.phases.len()` on a successful run.
  - `total_n_steps: u64` — sum of every phase's `n_steps`.
  - `total_elapsed_micros: u128` — wall-clock interval from the start
    of phase 0's warm-up through the end of the final phase's writer
    flushes. Includes per-phase setup, teardown, and per-phase
    timings-file writes.

- `PhaseSummary` — per-phase outcome record carried in <!-- rq-b00170c6 -->
  `RunSummary.phases`.
  - `name: String` — copied from the phase's `name` field.
  - `n_steps: u64` — the phase's configured `n_steps`.
  - `frames_written: u64` — number of trajectory frames written
    during the phase (zero when the phase's `trajectory_every == 0`).
  - `log_rows_written: u64` — number of CSV log rows written during
    the phase, excluding the header (zero when the phase's
    `log_every == 0`).
  - `elapsed_micros: u128` — wall-clock interval from the start of
    the phase's warm-up to the end of the phase's writer flushes.

- `lint_simulation(config_path: &Path, with_gpu: bool) -> LintReport` <!-- rq-4ff84310 -->
  - Convenience wrapper. Equivalent to
    `lint_simulation_with_registries(config_path,
    &Registries::with_builtins(), with_gpu)`.
  - Returns a fully populated `LintReport` rather than a `Result`:
    every error mode of the underlying loaders is captured as a
    `LintStatus::Fail` carrying the structured `RunnerError`. Callers
    inspect `report.ok()` or `report.first_failure()`.
  - The function never panics on user input. CPU-only mode performs
    no GPU access at all and is safe to call on a host without a
    CUDA device.

- `lint_simulation_with_registries(config_path: &Path, registries: &Registries, with_gpu: bool) -> LintReport` <!-- rq-9ed993de -->
  - Runs every stage of *Lint flow* against `registries`. The
    config-load stage uses `load_config_raw` followed by
    `config.validate_against(registries)` and
    `config.validate_constraint_compatibility(registries,
    has_constraints)` so per-kind validation runs against the
    caller-supplied registries (matching what
    `run_simulation_with_registries` does).
  - Short-circuits on the first stage that returns `Fail`: that
    stage's status is set to `Fail { detail, error }` and every
    subsequent stage's status is set to
    `Skipped { reason: "earlier check failed" }`.
  - When `with_gpu` is `false` the `gpu` stage is recorded as
    `NotChecked { reason: "re-run with --with-gpu" }`
    unconditionally. When `with_gpu` is `true` and every preceding
    stage passed, the function performs the steps listed under
    *Lint flow*'s *`--with-gpu` stages* and records the outcome.

- `Registries` — bundled handle to every open builder registry the <!-- rq-74bb02cc -->
  runner consults. Lives at `heddle_md::Registries` (the crate root,
  so it does not appear to belong to any single subsystem). Fields:
  - `integrators: IntegratorRegistry`
  - `thermostats: ThermostatRegistry`
  - `barostats: BarostatRegistry`
  - `constraint_types: ConstraintRegistry`
  - `potentials: PotentialRegistry`
  - `minimizers: MinimizerRegistry` — registry consulted by the
    minimization branch of the per-phase loop; see
    `rqm/minimization/steepest-descent.md`.
  - `analyses: AnalysisRegistry` — registry consulted by
    `heddlemd analyze`; see `rqm/analysis/framework.md`.

  Constructors:
  - `Registries::with_builtins() -> Registries` — every inner
    registry is `XRegistry::with_builtins()`. Used by
    `run_simulation` (the default-built-ins convenience wrapper)
    and by `run_analyses` (the analyze equivalent).
  - `Registries::new() -> Registries` — every inner registry is
    `XRegistry::new()` (empty). Callers that want full control
    over registration order start from `new()` and register every
    builder they need explicitly.

  Convenience registration methods, each forwarding to the matching
  inner registry's `register`:
  - `Registries::register_integrator(&mut self, builder: Box<dyn IntegratorBuilder>)`
  - `Registries::register_thermostat(&mut self, builder: Box<dyn ThermostatBuilder>)`
  - `Registries::register_barostat(&mut self, builder: Box<dyn BarostatBuilder>)`
  - `Registries::register_constraint_type(&mut self, builder: Box<dyn ConstraintBuilder>)`
  - `Registries::register_potential(&mut self, builder: Box<dyn PotentialBuilder>)`
  - `Registries::register_minimizer(&mut self, builder: Box<dyn MinimizerBuilder>)`
  - `Registries::register_analysis(&mut self, builder: Box<dyn AnalysisBuilder>)`

  Custom builders compose with the built-ins via the standard pattern:

  ```rust
  let mut registries = Registries::with_builtins();
  registries.register_integrator(Box::new(MyCustomIntegratorBuilder));
  registries.register_potential(Box::new(MyCustomPotentialBuilder));
  let summary = run_simulation_with_registries(&config_path, &registries)?;
  ```

  Or from an empty bundle when the caller wants no built-ins:

  ```rust
  let mut registries = Registries::new();
  registries.register_integrator(Box::new(VelocityVerletBuilder));
  registries.register_potential(Box::new(LennardJonesBuilder));
  // ... etc.
  ```

  The inner registry types remain accessible by their own paths
  (`heddle_md::integrator::IntegratorRegistry`,
  `heddle_md::forces::PotentialRegistry`, etc.) for callers that want
  to construct or compose a single registry without going through
  the bundle.

- `main(args: Vec<String>) -> ExitCode` (in `src/main.rs`) <!-- rq-f7e279ee -->
  - Parses the CLI and dispatches on the first argument:
    - `run <config-path>` calls `run_simulation` (the built-ins
      convenience wrapper), prints any error to stderr and the
      final-summary line to stdout, and returns the exit code
      described in *CLI*'s *`run` subcommand*.
    - `lint <config-path> [--with-gpu]` calls
      `lint_simulation(config_path, with_gpu)`, writes the report
      to stdout via `LintReport::write_to(&mut io::stdout())`,
      writes `error: {first_failure}` to stderr when
      `!report.ok()`, and returns the exit code described in
      *CLI*'s *`lint` subcommand* (`0` on `ok()`, `1` otherwise).
  - Any other invocation prints the usage block from
    *Usage error messages* and exits `1`.
  - The bundled CLI does not expose any mechanism for registering
    custom builders; a binary that wants custom builders is a Rust
    program depending on `heddle-md` that constructs its own
    `Registries` and calls `run_simulation_with_registries` or
    `lint_simulation_with_registries` directly.

## Determinism guarantees <!-- rq-0485e79f -->

The runner preserves the project's bit-wise reproducibility invariant:

- Velocity generation is fully deterministic in `(seed, temperature,
  masses, N)` (the masses and N derive from the config and init file).
- Every device kernel launch is on the default stream of the `Arc<CudaDevice>`
  carried by the `GpuContext` from `init_device()`; no other streams are
  introduced.
- `compute_kinetic_energy` sums in particle order, so the log values are
  byte-identical across runs on the same GPU.
- The Maxwell-Boltzmann RNG is `ChaCha8Rng::seed_from_u64(seed)` and is
  consumed in the order specified in *Sampling order*.

Two invocations of `heddlemd run sim.toml` with identical inputs on the
same hardware produce trajectory files and log files that are byte-identical.

## Out of Scope <!-- rq-1bf226c9 -->

- Restart files and `heddlemd resume` (separate planned feature).
- Multi-GPU and multi-host execution.
- Per-step force-field switching, time-varying parameters.
- Thermostat / barostat composition logic. The runner chains the
  three slot handles in a fixed order; per-slot algorithms live in
  the respective requirements files under `integration/`.
- Multi-type simulations. The runner rejects configs with more than one
  `[[particle_types]]` (`MultiTypeUnsupported`), pending a future
  multi-type LJ kernel.
- Energy minimisation / pre-equilibration steps.
- Per-particle mass overrides in the init file.
- Subsampling the trajectory in space (region selectors, type filters).
- CLI flags beyond the positional `<config-path>`. No `--seed`, no
  `--steps`, no `--config`. Every parameter is in the file.
- Live console output beyond the simple progress line (e.g. interactive
  energy plots, TUI dashboards).
- Validation that `pair_interactions[0].cutoff <= min(box edge) / 2`.
  The current LJ kernel and PBC code do not enforce this; the runner
  inherits whatever behaviour those layers produce when the cutoff
  exceeds the half-box.
- Removing per-axis angular momentum during velocity generation.
  Removing linear momentum is sufficient for the current scale; angular
  momentum drifts on the order of the temperature.

  @rq-91f5f34e
  Scenario: Config rejected by the filename convention
    Given tmp/sim.toml is otherwise valid (but lacks the `.in.toml` suffix)

    And stderr contains "InvalidConfigFilename" and "sim.toml"
    And the file at tmp/sim.toml was not opened

  @rq-f6927716
  Scenario: Init file rejected by load_init_state
    Given tmp/sim.in.toml references init="bad.xyz"
    And tmp/bad.xyz has a position outside the primary cell
    When heddlemd is invoked with arguments ["run", "tmp/sim.in.toml"]
    Then it exits with code 1
    And stderr contains "PositionOutsideBox"

  # --- Output overwrite ---

  @rq-d9a98e51
  Scenario: Pre-flight refuses to overwrite existing trajectory
    Given tmp/sim.in.toml is valid with trajectory_every=5
    And tmp/sim.out.xyz already exists
    When heddlemd is invoked with arguments ["run", "tmp/sim.in.toml"]
    Then it exits with code 1

    And the init file is not read (verified by check that load_init_state was not entered)

  @rq-52c483c0
  Scenario: Pre-flight refuses to overwrite existing log
    Given tmp/sim.in.toml is valid with log_every=5
    And tmp/sim.out.log already exists

    Given tmp/sim.in.toml has trajectory_every=0 and log_every=0
    And tmp/sim.out.xyz and tmp/sim.out.log both already exist with arbitrary content
    And tmp/sim.out.timings does not exist
    When heddlemd is invoked with arguments ["run", "tmp/sim.in.toml"]

    And tmp/sim.out.timings exists

  @rq-fc523f30
  Scenario: Pre-flight refuses to overwrite existing timings file
    Given tmp/sim.in.toml is valid
    And tmp/sim.out.timings already exists with arbitrary content
    When heddlemd is invoked with arguments ["run", "tmp/sim.in.toml"]
    Then it exits with code 1
    And stderr contains "OutputExists" and "sim.out.timings"

  # --- Velocity generation ---

  @rq-621ce7b6
  Scenario: Sampled velocities round-trip to the configured temperature
    Given tmp/sim.in.toml has seed=1, temperature=300.0, n_steps=0
    And tmp/sim.in.xyz has 100 particles with positions but no velocities
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then it exits with code 0
    And the step-0 log row's kinetic_energy is greater than 0
    And the step-0 log row's temperature equals 300.0 within a relative tolerance of 1e-4
      (the rescale makes this an exact round-trip up to f32 velocity-storage round-off,
       not a statistical estimate)

  @rq-04fda32f
  Scenario: Explicit init velocities override sampled velocities
    Given tmp/sim.in.xyz declares velocities of (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) m/s for every particle
    And tmp/sim.in.toml has temperature=300.0 (would normally sample)
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then the step-0 log row's kinetic_energy equals 0.5 * sum(m_i) * 1.0^2 exactly (no RNG consumed)

  @rq-f8df9364
  Scenario: Velocity generation is deterministic in the seed
    Given two identical configs and init files, both with no velocities in the init
    When heddlemd is invoked on each
    Then the two resulting log files are byte-identical
    And the two resulting trajectory files are byte-identical

  @rq-81b241e7
  Scenario: Different seeds produce different velocities
    Given two configs identical except seed=1 vs seed=2
    When heddlemd is invoked on each
    Then the two resulting log files differ on the step-0 row's kinetic_energy

  @rq-3c17477d
  Scenario: Total momentum after generation is zero (within f32 round-off)
    Given a config with seed=42, temperature=300.0, N=64 particles, equal masses
    When heddlemd is invoked with n_steps=0
    And the per-axis momenta are computed from the step-0 frame velocities
    Then |p_x|, |p_y|, |p_z| are each less than 1e-3 times the typical thermal momentum

  @rq-f7e2d0f1
  Scenario: temperature=0 yields exactly zero velocities and skips momentum subtraction and rescaling
    Given a config with temperature=0.0 and N=4
    When heddlemd is invoked with n_steps=0
    Then every velocity component written to the step-0 frame is exactly 0.0_f32

  @rq-d82ce4aa
  Scenario: Single-particle generated velocities are zeroed for lack of thermal degrees of freedom
    Given a config with seed=1, temperature=300.0, and N=1, with no init velocities
    When heddlemd is invoked with n_steps=0
    Then the rescale step sets the single particle's velocity components to exactly zero
      (a centred one-particle system has no thermal degrees of freedom)
    And the step-0 log row's kinetic_energy is exactly 0.0 and temperature is exactly 0.0

  # --- Timestep loop ---

  @rq-985230a5
  Scenario: Loop executes exactly n_steps integration steps
    Given a config with n_steps=7 and trajectory_every=1 and log_every=1
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then the trajectory contains 8 frames (steps 0..=7)
    And the log contains 8 rows (steps 0..=7)

  @rq-18f7fce9
  Scenario: trajectory_every > n_steps writes only the step-0 frame
    Given a config with n_steps=5 and trajectory_every=100
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then the trajectory contains exactly 1 frame at step=0

  @rq-56ad97f1
  Scenario: log_every > n_steps writes only the step-0 row
    Given a config with n_steps=5 and log_every=100
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then the log contains the header plus exactly 1 row at step=0

  @rq-ff707382
  Scenario: n_steps = 0 writes only step-0 outputs
    Given a config with n_steps=0, trajectory_every=10, log_every=10
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then the trajectory contains exactly 1 frame at step=0
    And the log contains the header plus exactly 1 row at step=0

  @rq-fe1eaade
  Scenario: Reproducibility byte-for-byte across two identical runs
    Given a config with n_steps=200 and explicit init velocities
    When heddlemd is invoked twice on the same files
    Then the two resulting trajectory files are byte-identical
    And the two resulting log files are byte-identical

  # --- Integrator selection ---

  @rq-9eb167f0
  Scenario: Lossless mode selects the lossless integrator kernels
    Given a config with integrator.kind="velocity-verlet" and lossless=true
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then it exits with code 0
    And the simulation completes without GPU error

  @rq-a97789e6
  Scenario: Lossy mode is the default for velocity-Verlet
    Given a config with [integrator] kind="velocity-verlet" and no lossless field
    When the config is loaded
    Then config.integrator.kind equals "velocity-verlet"
    And config.integrator.params.get("lossless") equals Some(toml::Value::Boolean(false))

  @rq-00cbbf51
  Scenario: Langevin BAOAB runs end-to-end through the runner
    Given a valid config with [integrator] kind="langevin-baoab",
      friction=1.0e12, temperature=300.0, seed=42, n_steps=5
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then it exits with code 0
    And the trajectory and log files exist
    And the timings file contains rows for KernelStage::LangevinKickHalf,
      KernelStage::LangevinDriftHalf, and KernelStage::LangevinOuStep

  @rq-88e3ac79
  Scenario: Switching integrator.kind changes the trajectory
    Given two configs identical except [integrator] kind="velocity-verlet" vs
      [integrator] kind="langevin-baoab" (with friction=1.0e12, temperature=300.0, seed=1)
    When heddlemd is invoked on each
    Then the two trajectory files differ

  # --- Multi-type restriction ---

  @rq-34db7b7b
  Scenario: Refuse to run with multiple types
    Given tmp/sim.in.toml declares particle_types ["Ar", "Kr"] and all three pair interactions
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then it exits with code 1
    And stderr contains "MultiTypeUnsupported"

  # --- Empty system ---

  @rq-d065447f
  Scenario: Run an empty (N=0) simulation
    Given tmp/sim.in.xyz declares N=0 with a valid Lattice
    And tmp/sim.in.toml is otherwise valid with n_steps=5, trajectory_every=1, log_every=1
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then it exits with code 0
    And the trajectory contains 6 frames each with N=0 data rows
    And every log row has kinetic_energy=0 and temperature=0

  # --- Neighbor list / box-size compatibility ---

  @rq-4b4f85c7
  Scenario: Box too small for cell-list rejected before forces are constructed
    Given tmp/sim.in.toml has [neighbor_list] mode="cell-list" r_skin=1.0e-10
      and one [[pair_interactions]] with cutoff=1.0e-9
    And tmp/sim.in.xyz has an orthorhombic box with lx=2.0e-9, ly=lz=5.0e-9
    When heddlemd is invoked with arguments ["run", "tmp/sim.in.toml"]
    Then it exits with code 1
    And stderr contains "CellListBoxTooSmall" and "a" and "2"

  @rq-0cb544f4
  Scenario: Coulomb cutoff participates in box-too-small check
    Given tmp/sim.in.toml has [neighbor_list] mode="cell-list" r_skin=1.0e-10
      and one [[pair_interactions]] with cutoff=5.0e-10
      and a [coulomb] table with cutoff=2.0e-9 (the larger of the two)
    And tmp/sim.in.xyz has an orthorhombic box with lx=ly=lz=5.0e-9
      (so 3*(2.0e-9 + 1.0e-10) = 6.3e-9 > 5.0e-9)
    When heddlemd is invoked with arguments ["run", "tmp/sim.in.toml"]
    Then it exits with code 1
    And stderr contains "CellListBoxTooSmall"

  @rq-21d27f06
  Scenario: All-pairs mode skips the box-too-small check
    Given tmp/sim.in.toml has [neighbor_list] mode="all-pairs"
      and one [[pair_interactions]] with cutoff=1.0e-9
    And tmp/sim.in.xyz has box edges (2.0e-9, 2.0e-9, 2.0e-9)
    When heddlemd is invoked
    Then it exits with code 0

  # --- GPU initialisation failure ---

  @rq-57c1b6a3
  Scenario: No GPU available
    Given no CUDA-capable GPU is present
    When heddlemd is invoked with a valid config
    Then it exits with code 1
    And stderr contains "Gpu" or "CUDA"

  # --- Run summary ---

  @rq-f4a85dda
  Scenario: RunSummary reflects what was actually written
    Given a config with n_steps=100, trajectory_every=25, log_every=10

  Scenario: SimulationSetup::new returns a populated struct on a valid config
    Given a valid `.in.toml` config and matching `.in.xyz` init file
    And a `Registries` bundle constructed via Registries::with_builtins()
    When SimulationSetup::new(&config_path, registries) is called
    Then it returns Ok(setup)

  Scenario: SimulationSetup::new performs the initial-velocity constraint projection
    Given a config with a non-empty `[constraints]` section, a positive
      `simulation.temperature`, and `N >= 2`, with init velocities absent
    When SimulationSetup::new(&config_path, registries) is called
    Then it returns Ok(setup)
    And every constraint pair (i, j) in setup.constraint_list satisfies
      `(v_i − v_j) · (r_i − r_j) == 0` within the RATTLE convergence tolerance
    And the kinetic energy computed from setup.buffers equals
      `0.5 * setup.n_thermal_dof * config.simulation.temperature` within
      f32 round-off

  Scenario: SimulationSetup::new skips the initial-velocity projection on
    constraint-free configs
    Given a config whose topology section has no `[constraints]` (or whose
      `[constraints]` section is empty)

  Scenario: run_md_phase from a constructed setup matches run_simulation_with_registries
    Given a single-MD-phase config and a constructed SimulationSetup
    When run_md_phase(&mut setup, &config.phases[0].as_md(), 0) is called
    Then it returns Ok(phase_summary)
    And the phase_summary equals the phase entry that
      run_simulation_with_registries(&config_path, &registries) would
      have produced for phase 0

    And summary.phases[0] equals the result of
      run_md_phase(&mut setup, &config.phases[0].as_md(), 0) on a fresh setup
    And summary.phases[1] equals the result of
      run_minimization_phase(&mut setup, &config.phases[1].as_min(), 1) on the

    Given a config that exercises every with-gpu setup step (SPME enabled,
      constraints present, init velocities absent)
    When SimulationSetup::new(&config_path, registries) and
      lint_simulation_with_registries(&config_path, &registries, true) are
      both called
    Then the sequence of step-helper calls observed by a registered tracing
      hook is identical between the two code paths
    And every step helper is called from a single source-code site (no
      parallel reimplementation in the lint pipeline)

  Scenario: run_simulation defers to run_simulation_with_registries with built-ins
    Given a valid config that uses only built-in slot kinds

    Then it returns the same RunSummary as
      run_simulation_with_registries(&config_path, &Registries::with_builtins())

  @rq-923fc84f
  Scenario: run_simulation_with_registries dispatches an integrator from a user-registered builder
    Given a valid config whose [integrator] section sets kind = "my-stub"
    And a Registries bundle constructed via Registries::with_builtins()
      then `register_integrator(Box::new(MyStubBuilder))` where
      MyStubBuilder::kind_name() returns "my-stub"
    When run_simulation_with_registries(&config_path, &registries) is called
    Then it returns Ok(summary)
    And the dispatched integrator is the one constructed by MyStubBuilder
      (verified e.g. by a side-channel counter the builder closes over)

  @rq-fb917fd5

    Given a valid config that activates the conditions for a user-defined Potential
    And a Registries bundle whose `register_potential(Box::new(MyPotentialBuilder))`
      has been called after with_builtins()

  Scenario: run_simulation rejects a custom-kind config because its built-in registries do not match
    Given a valid config whose [integrator] section sets kind = "my-stub"
    When run_simulation(&config_path) is called (which uses Registries::with_builtins())
    Then it returns Err(RunnerError::Config(ConfigError::UnknownKind {

     that has the custom builder registered)
